  <string name="FLETCH/RandomConvo_016_Option_000">What’s your first name?</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/RandomConvo_016_Option_001">Why does everyone call you that?</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/RandomConvo_016_Response_000_000">&lt;thinking&gt;Hmmm…</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/RandomConvo_016_Response_000_001">&lt;haha&gt;I’ll tell you what, I might tell you one day...</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/RandomConvo_016_Response_001_000">&lt;yes&gt;Everyone called my Father &lt;myName&gt;. It was just easier.</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/RandomConvo_016_Response_001_001">&lt;haha&gt;I guess the name just stuck on me too!</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/RandomConvo_017_Intro_000">&lt;pumped&gt;There’s so much for us still to discover here on &lt;IslandName&gt;!</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/RandomConvo_017_Intro_001">&lt;glee&gt;I can’t I just can’t wait to hear all about it.</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/RandomConvo_018_Intro_000">&lt;no&gt;You really should sleep more often &lt;PlayerName&gt;, it’s no good to run around with low energy!</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/RandomConvo_018_Intro_001">I'll tell you what, why not take the rest of the day off?</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/RandomConvo_019_Intro_000">You know what I hated most about &lt;SouthCity&gt;?</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/RandomConvo_019_Intro_001">&lt;no&gt;The terrible, terrible food they have there.</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/RandomConvo_019_Intro_002">&lt;BlobFish&gt;? Forget about that!</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/RandomConvo_019_Intro_003">&lt;no&gt;I’ll tell you what, those things tasted like wet cardboard.</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/RandomConvo_019_Intro_004">&lt;haha&gt;Except wet cardboard has more texture!</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/RandomConvo_020_Intro_000">Thank you for looking after my Father’s &lt;Journal&gt;.</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/RandomConvo_020_Intro_001">&lt;proud&gt;I’ll tell you what, some of those milestones will be tough to beat!</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/RandomConvo_020_Intro_002">&lt;yes&gt;But take your time, &lt;PlayerName&gt;.</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/RandomConvo_020_Intro_003">&lt;glee&gt;I’m sure you’ll reach them eventually!</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/RandomConvo_021_Intro_000">I’ll tell you what, it’s just really nice to get out and about every once in a while, eh?</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/RandomConvo_021_Intro_001">&lt;proud&gt;Exercise really gets my blood pumping!</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/RandomConvo_022_Intro_000">&lt;thinking&gt;The animals on &lt;IslandName&gt; aren’t quite the same as I remember them...</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/RandomConvo_022_Intro_001">&lt;yes&gt;I guess so much has happened since then.</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/RandomConvo_022_Intro_002">For all of us.</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/RandomConvo_023_Intro_000">I don’t know why there’s so little motivation in &lt;SouthCity&gt;.</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/RandomConvo_023_Intro_001">Why people don’t have a sense of adventure or passion.</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/RandomConvo_023_Intro_002">&lt;yes&gt;I suppose those that do just don’t last long there...</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/RandomConvo_024_Intro_000">I’ll tell you what, if I were younger...</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/RandomConvo_024_Intro_001">&lt;haha&gt;I still don’t think I’d be able to do all the things you do, &lt;PlayerName&gt;! </string>
  <string name="FLETCH/RandomConvo_025_Intro_000">I'll tell you what, &lt;PlayerName&gt;.</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/RandomConvo_025_Intro_001">&lt;pumped&gt;We’ve been getting on like a house on fire!</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/RandomConvo_025_Intro_002">&lt;shy&gt;Thanks for keeping on keeping on, you little rascal you.</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/RandomConvo_026_Intro_000">I’ll tel you what, you can stand around all day waiting for something to happen…</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/RandomConvo_026_Intro_001">&lt;proud&gt;Or you can get out there and get it done!</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/RandomConvo_026_Intro_002">&lt;yes&gt;I like that about you, &lt;PlayerName&gt;.</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/RandomConvo_026_Intro_003">&lt;haha&gt;I tell you what, you’ve been getting it done.</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/RandomConvo_027_Intro_000">I’ll tell you what, age has a funny way of sneaking up on you.</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/RandomConvo_027_Intro_001">If you keep yourself busy and focused, you don’t notice it happening at all!</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/RandomConvo_027_Intro_002">&lt;haha&gt;I remember catching my reflection once and thinking “Who’s this old lady in my house?”</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/RandomConvo_028_Intro_000">For a long long time I felt like I was just treading water and waiting for something big to happen.</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/RandomConvo_028_Intro_001">&lt;no&gt;You really can’t be like that though.</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/RandomConvo_028_Intro_002">&lt;thinking&gt;Not if you want to be happy.</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/RandomConvo_028_Intro_003">&lt;proud&gt;You have to MAKE things happen yourself!</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/RandomConvo_028_Intro_004">&lt;yes&gt;Give yourself a goal, a purpose!</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/RandomConvo_028_Intro_005">&lt;pumped&gt;Beat those milestones!</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/RandomConvo_029_Intro_000">It’s funny how things change when you get older...</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/RandomConvo_029_Intro_001">&lt;shy&gt;I look back at times I felt embarrassed, and they just make me chuckle now.</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/RandomConvo_029_Intro_002">Things I cared about so much can just seem silly.</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/RandomConvo_029_Intro_003">Time can really put things into perspective, don’t you think?</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/RandomConvo_029_Intro_004">The rough stuff gets sanded over, but the bright stuff shines even brighter!</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/RandomConvo_030_Intro_000">I’ll tell you what, saving up for all these years, I would have never imagined seeing &lt;IslandName&gt; look like this again.</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/RandomConvo_030_Intro_001">&lt;yes&gt;While it’s not exactly how I remember it, it feels nice knowing that &lt;IslandName&gt; is someone's home again.</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/RandomConvo_030_Intro_002">I think my Father would be very proud of what we’ve done here, &lt;PlayerName&gt;.</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/RandomConvo_030_Intro_003">&lt;haha&gt;But I’ll tell you what, I’m very proud of what you’ve done here!</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/RandomConvo_031_Intro_000">&lt;yes&gt;It’s always so nice to see you &lt;PlayerName&gt;.</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/RandomConvo_031_Intro_001">&lt;shy&gt;I’ll tell you what, if I don’t get to talk to you at least once a day, I feel like I’ve missed out!</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/RandomConvo_032_Intro_000">&lt;sigh&gt;I really wish you could have met my Father, &lt;PlayerName&gt;.</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/RandomConvo_032_Intro_001">&lt;haha&gt;He would give you a run for your money, let me tell you!</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/RandomConvo_032_Intro_002">&lt;glee&gt;It felt like that man could never run out of energy!</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/RandomConvo_033_Intro_000">You’re the best thing that ever happened to me, &lt;PlayerName&gt;.</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/RandomConvo_033_Intro_001">Sometimes I keep myself up late at night imagining that someone else responded to that ad...</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/RandomConvo_033_Intro_002">&lt;worried&gt;Oh, no!</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/RandomConvo_033_Intro_003">&lt;no&gt;But I’ll tell you what, there is no point in thinking like that!</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/RandomConvo_033_Intro_004">&lt;haha&gt;You’re here, and that’s all that matters!</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/RandomConvo_034_Intro_000">My father always used to say: “You keep your friends close, and your best friends closer.”</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/RandomConvo_034_Intro_001">&lt;haha&gt; He wasn’t much of a wordy, but he knew how to get things done, make no mistake.</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/RandomConvo_034_Intro_002">&lt;yes&gt;Always looking out for his friends, he was.</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/RandomConvo_034_Intro_003">&lt;yes&gt;Just like you &lt;PlayerName&gt;.</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/StartingConversationTent_Intro_000">Ah! So, you're interested in applying for a house deed?</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/StartingConversationTent_Intro_001">I'll just let you know there is a &lt;getHousePrice&gt; up front fee. &lt;thinking&gt;</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/StartingConversationTent_Intro_002">Oh, and once you've applied for the deed, you will have to source the construction materials yourself. &lt;yes&gt;</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/StartingConversationTent_Intro_003">So, are you interested in applying for a house of your own?</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/StartingConversationTent_Option_000">I want to apply for a house.</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/StartingConversationTent_Option_001">Nevermind.</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/StartingConversationTent_Response_001_000">Well, I'll let you have a think about it.</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/StartingConversationTent_Response_001_001">Let me know if you change your mind.</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/StartingConversation_Option_000">I want to upgrade</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/StartingConversation_Option_001">I want to move my house.</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/StartingConversation_Option_002">Nevermind</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/StartingConversation_Response_001_000">Hmmm...</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/StartingConversation_Response_002_000">Alright then, &lt;PlayerName&gt;.</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/StartingConvo_Option_000">Can I see the deeds?</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/StartingConvo_Option_001">I want to move a building.</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/StartingConvo_Option_002">Nevermind.</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/StartingConvo_Response_001_000">Lets see what we can do...</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/StartingConvo_Response_002_000">Talk again soon, okay?</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/TownIsInDebt_Intro_000">&lt;thinking&gt;Moving the building can be a bit expensive...</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/TownIsInDebt_Intro_001">&lt;yes&gt;Let's get that town debt payed off before we move any buildings, okay?</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/TownMention_Level_001_Intro_000">Although this isn’t the &lt;IslandName&gt; I remember, it's still amazing seeing the changes you’ve made around here &lt;PlayerName&gt;.</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/TownMention_Level_001_Intro_001">I think my father would be proud of us!</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/TownMention_Level_002_Intro_000">Remember back when you were setting tents up for us both?</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/TownMention_Level_002_Intro_001">Look at &lt;IslandName&gt; now!</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/TownMention_Level_002_Intro_002">You’ve done such a good job, I’ll tell you what!</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/TownMention_Level_003_Intro_000">Oh, &lt;PlayerName&gt;.</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/TownMention_Level_003_Intro_001">I’ll tell you what, it really warms my heart to see &lt;IslandName&gt; bustling again.</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/TownMention_Level_003_Intro_002">Things are really shaping up around here, thanks to you!</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/TownMention_Level_004_Intro_000">&lt;no&gt;I would have never imagined seeing &lt;IslandName&gt; looking like this again..</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/TownMention_Level_004_Intro_001">&lt;boohoo&gt;You’ve really made an old woman very happy, &lt;PlayerName&gt;.</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/TownMention_Level_004_Intro_002">Thanks for everything you’ve done, &lt;PlayerName&gt;!</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/Upgrade House No Money Tent_Intro_000">Very good!</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/Upgrade House No Money Tent_Intro_001">...Oh. It seems like you a bit short on cash. &lt;shy&gt;</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/Upgrade House No Money Tent_Intro_002">Perhaps you can come back when your pockets are a bit heavier?</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/Upgrade House No Money_Intro_000">Well, to make your house bigger its going to cost &lt;getHousePrice&gt; .  How does that sound?</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/Upgrade House No Money_Option_000">Yes!</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/Upgrade House No Money_Option_001">Maybe later.</string>

  <string name="FLETCH/Upgrade House No Money_Response_001_000">Well, if you change your mind, please come speak to me.</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/Upgrade HouseTent_Intro_000">Alright I'll take &lt;getHousePrice&gt; from you.</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/Upgrade HouseTent_Intro_001">You'll find the construction material box in front of your house.</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/Upgrade HouseTent_Intro_002">As soon as it's full you'll find the construction will be completed over night.</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/Upgrade HouseTent_Intro_003">Don't worry. I hire very quiet workers. You won't hear a peep out of them! &lt;haha&gt;</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/Upgrade HouseTent_Intro_004">I hope you're looking forward to your new house! &lt;glee&gt;</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/Upgrade House_Intro_000">Well, to make your house bigger its going to cost &lt;getHousePrice&gt;. How does that sound?</string>

  <string name="FLETCH/Upgrade House_Response_000_000">Okay. We'll set up a construction box infront of your house. &lt;yes&gt;</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/Upgrade House_Response_000_001">We wont be able to start construction until you fill the box with the required construction materials. &lt;yes&gt;</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/Upgrade House_Response_000_002">As so you as have all the required materials, construction can begin!</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/Upgrade House_Response_001_000">Well, if you change your mind, please come speak to me.</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/WantToMoveBuilding_Intro_000">So we're going to relocate &lt;relocateBuildingName&gt;?</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/WantToMoveBuilding_Intro_001">Relocating the building will put the town &lt;sprite=11&gt;25,000 in debt.</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/WantToMoveBuilding_Intro_002">Is that okay?</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/WantToMoveBuilding_Option_000">Let's move it!</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/WantToMoveBuilding_Option_001">Nevermind...</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/WantToMoveBuilding_Response_000_000">Ok! Lets do it!</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/WantToMoveBuilding_Response_000_001">Here is the &lt;itemName&gt;. Place it down in the new place we want the &lt;relocateBuildingName&gt;.</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/WantToMoveBuilding_Response_000_002">&lt;yes&gt;The building will be moved over night.</string>

  <!-- Talking about Item: Berkonium Ore -->
  <string name="FLETCH/Quest_22_Intro_Intro_002">&lt;thinking&gt;You see, &lt;AirShips&gt; can currently only arrive on &lt;IslandName&gt;.</string>
  <!-- Talking about Item: Berkonium Ore -->
  <string name="FLETCH/Quest_22_Intro_Intro_003">&lt;yes&gt;But, with an Airport, we’d be able to depart from &lt;IslandName&gt; and visit some of the smaller islands out in the great unknown!</string>

  <string name="FLETCH/FirstDayFaintConvo_Intro_005">It looks like you fainted out there!</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/FirstDayFaintConvo_Intro_006">&lt;yes&gt;Please be careful out there and always keep an eye on your health and energy.</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/FirstDayFaintConvo_Intro_007">&lt;no&gt;If the world starts losing colour you know you’ve worked too hard.</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/FirstDayFaintConvo_Intro_008">&lt;yes&gt;Please make sure you eat something to keep your energy up.</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/FirstDayFaintConvo_Intro_009">&lt;shy&gt;When you didn’t return after a while, I had to call for a search party from &lt;SouthCity&gt; to come and find you.</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/FirstDayFaintConvo_Intro_010">&lt;worried&gt;Those guys delivered you here, but it looks like they went through your pockets and took a fair cut of your &lt;Dinks&gt;.</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/FirstDayFaintConvo_Intro_011">Maybe they thought you wouldn't notice?</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/FirstDayFaintConvo_Intro_012">&lt;thinking&gt;It looks like some of your tools have taken a bit of damage too…</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/FirstDayFaintConvo_Intro_013">Please be careful out there, &lt;PlayerName&gt;.</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/LongConvo_001_Intro_000">Oh, hey &lt;PlayerName&gt;. Did I ever tell you why we had to leave &lt;IslandName&gt; all those years ago?</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/LongConvo_001_Intro_001">You see, growing up, I didn’t even know the world had gone south!</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/LongConvo_001_Intro_002">&lt;yes&gt;Everything had always been okay here on &lt;IslandName&gt;. </string>
  <string name="FLETCH/LongConvo_001_Intro_003">My family and I had everything we needed. This place was our home and we all had each other.</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/LongConvo_001_Intro_004">&lt;thinking&gt;Until one day, when we had a big scare.</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/LongConvo_001_Intro_005">You see, some people arrived from &lt;SouthCity&gt; in some &lt;AirShips&gt;. They told us we needed to evacuate &lt;IslandName&gt;.</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/LongConvo_001_Intro_006">&lt;no&gt;They said a big &lt;Shift&gt; was coming, and the whole island was going to be ripped apart.</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/LongConvo_001_Intro_007">&lt;worried&gt;I’ll tell you what, I remember my Father was so scared.</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/LongConvo_001_Intro_008">&lt;no&gt;So we packed our whole lives up. Everyone did.</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/LongConvo_001_Intro_009">Next thing we knew, we were living in &lt;SouthCity&gt;.</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/LongConvo_001_Intro_010">They told us we could come back once the &lt;Shift&gt; had ended, and the island was safe again...</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/LongConvo_001_Intro_011">&lt;sigh&gt;But then my Father got crook…</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/LongConvo_001_Intro_012">Oh, crikey!</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/LongConvo_001_Intro_013">&lt;haha&gt;I’ll tell you what, old &lt;myName&gt; can jibber-jabber. </string>
  <string name="FLETCH/LongConvo_001_Intro_014">&lt;shy&gt;I’m feelin better now! Thanks for listening, &lt;PlayerName&gt;.</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/LongConvo_002_Intro_000">I’ll tell you what, I think my father would be so proud to see &lt;IslandName&gt; the way it is today.</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/LongConvo_002_Intro_001">He was a man that loved this island. It was very hard for him when we had to evacuate &lt;IslandName&gt;.</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/LongConvo_002_Intro_002">&lt;no&gt;He didn’t take well to the lifestyle in &lt;SouthCity&gt; at all.</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/LongConvo_002_Intro_003">&lt;haha&gt;He hated how you had to fill out a form to do everything!</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/LongConvo_002_Intro_004">He wanted to get back to &lt;IslandName&gt; as soon as possible.</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/LongConvo_002_Intro_005">&lt;sigh&gt;Unfortunately, the cold must have got to him. </string>
  <string name="FLETCH/LongConvo_002_Intro_006">&lt;no&gt;He got real crook, real quick.</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/LongConvo_002_Intro_007">&lt;no&gt;He never did get better.</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/LongConvo_002_Intro_008">&lt;sigh&gt;In the end I went to live with a family from &lt;SouthCity&gt;. They taught me the ways of life there. </string>
  <string name="FLETCH/LongConvo_002_Intro_009">&lt;no&gt;But I never did forget my Father.</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/LongConvo_002_Intro_010">You see, I had his journal. I knew the things the man had done.</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/LongConvo_002_Intro_011">Those milestones he’d reached.</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/LongConvo_002_Intro_012">&lt;yes&gt;I’m glad you have that journal now, &lt;PlayerName&gt;.</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/LongConvo_002_Intro_013">Now, you bloody better keep reaching those milestones!</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/LongConvo_003_Intro_000">Hey, &lt;PlayerName&gt;.</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/LongConvo_003_Intro_001">Did you know I got into a fair bit of trouble when I was younger?</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/LongConvo_003_Intro_002">I’ll tell you what, back in &lt;SouthCity&gt;, when I was about your age, I did some bloody naughty stuff.</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/LongConvo_003_Option_000">Like What?</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/LongConvo_003_Option_001">I don’t believe you!</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/LongConvo_003_Response_000_000">&lt;shy&gt;Oh, maybe old &lt;myName&gt; has said too much, eh?</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/LongConvo_003_Response_000_001">&lt;no&gt;I don’t wanna go putting ideas into your head.</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/LongConvo_003_Response_000_002">&lt;yes&gt;I’ll tell you what, you’re a good kid, &lt;PlayerName&gt;.</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/LongConvo_003_Response_000_003">&lt;haha&gt;Let’s keep it that way!</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/LongConvo_003_Response_001_000">&lt;shy&gt;Well, I wasn’t always daggy, old &lt;myName&gt; that’s for sure!</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/LongConvo_003_Response_001_001">&lt;sigh&gt;But there are plenty of things I regret, let me tell you.</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/LongConvo_003_Response_001_002">I wish I was more like you are now, &lt;PlayerName&gt;.</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/LongConvo_003_Response_001_003">I’ll tell you what, you’re a bloody good kid!</string>

  <string name="FLETCH/LongConvo_004_Intro_001">I couldn’t have asked for a better partner!</string>
  <string name="FLETCH/LongConvo_004_Intro_002">I’ll tell you what, I had been planning the trip back to &lt;IslandName&gt; for a long time.</string>

  <string name="FLETCH/NPC_006_RandomConvo_000(Clone)_Intro_1">It’s probably because you don’t talk as much as I do! You really know how to listen.</string>
