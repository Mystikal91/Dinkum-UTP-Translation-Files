  <string name="MILBURN/BankConversation_Intro_000">Welcome to the &lt;IslandName&gt; Bank.</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/BankConversation_Intro_001">Hmph. What do you need?</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/BankConversation_Option_000">Show me my account.</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/BankConversation_Option_001">Let's chat.</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/BankConversation_Option_002">Nevermind.</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/BankConversation_Response_000_000">Ok. Lets take a look...</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/BankConversation_Response_002_000">Have a great day.</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/CompleteBirthday_000_Intro_000">&lt;proud&gt;Hmph.</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/CompleteBirthday_000_Intro_001">I usually buy my own &lt;birthday&gt; gifts.</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/CompleteBirthday_000_Intro_002">Thank you, &lt;PlayerName&gt;.</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/CompleteRequest_000_Intro_000">&lt;proud&gt;Hmph.</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/CompleteRequest_000_Intro_001">Very good.</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/CompleteRequest_000_Intro_002">I suppose you would like a reward now?</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/Introduction_010_Intro_000">&lt;PlayerName&gt; I assume?</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/Introduction_010_Intro_001">&lt;proud&gt;My name is &lt;myName&gt;.</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/Introduction_010_Intro_002">&lt;yes&gt;I am the new banker here on &lt;IslandName&gt;.</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/Introduction_010_Intro_003">Am I to understand that you were instrumental in getting my magnificent bank built?</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/Introduction_010_Intro_004">&lt;proud&gt;Well, trust me, the honour is all yours for having &lt;myName&gt; here on your tiny little island.</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/Introduction_010_Intro_005">Hmph. Using my bank will be free, of course.</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/Introduction_010_Intro_006">Would you like me to explain how the bank works?</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/Introduction_010_Option_000">Yes please.</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/Introduction_010_Option_001">I get it.</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/Introduction_010_Response_000_000">Well it’s very simple.</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/Introduction_010_Response_000_001">Any &lt;Dinks&gt; you deposit in the bank will slowly accrue interest.</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/Introduction_010_Response_000_002">&lt;no&gt;Hmph. You'll be bleeding me dry, I tell you!</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/Introduction_010_Response_000_003">Additionally, any &lt;Dinks&gt; you place into your account can be extracted from any other bank you visit.</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/Introduction_010_Response_000_004">That means if you visit somewhere and they have a bank, you can withdraw what few precious little &lt;Dinks&gt; you have deposited.</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/Introduction_010_Response_000_005">&lt;yes&gt;Finally, I offer a little exchange scheme.</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/Introduction_010_Response_000_006">You see, I happen to have to many &lt;PermitPoints&gt;.</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/Introduction_010_Response_000_007">&lt;no&gt;And you can never have have too many &lt;Dinks&gt;.</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/Introduction_010_Response_000_008">So come and speak to me during my operating hours to exhange &lt;Dinks&gt; for &lt;PermitPoints&gt;</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/Introduction_010_Response_001_000">&lt;thinking&gt;Ah, I see, someone on this island who knows the ins and outs of finance.</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/Introduction_010_Response_001_001">&lt;yes&gt;Looking forward to seeing your &lt;Dinks&gt;, &lt;PlayerName&gt;.</string>
  <!-- Talking about NPC: Fletch -->
  <string name="MILBURN/IslandDayGreeting_AfterNoon_010_Intro_000">Hmph.</string>
  <!-- Talking about NPC: Fletch -->
  <string name="MILBURN/IslandDayGreeting_AfterNoon_010_Intro_001">Today has been satisfactory so far.</string>
  <!-- Talking about NPC: Fletch -->
  <string name="MILBURN/IslandDayGreeting_AfterNoon_010_Intro_002">However, I do doubt that the “surprise” &lt;NPCName&gt; has in store for us tonight will impress me.</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/IslandDayGreeting_Morning_010_Intro_000">&lt;no&gt;Hmph.</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/IslandDayGreeting_Morning_010_Intro_001">What even is a &lt;SnagSizzle&gt;?</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/IslandDayGreeting_Morning_010_Intro_002">What’s so good about &lt;Snags&gt; anyway?</string>
  <!-- Talking about NPC: Fletch -->
  <string name="MILBURN/IslandDayGreeting_Night_010_Intro_000">Hmph.</string>
  <!-- Talking about NPC: Fletch -->
  <string name="MILBURN/IslandDayGreeting_Night_010_Intro_001">I don’t know what to say.</string>
  <!-- Talking about NPC: Fletch -->
  <string name="MILBURN/IslandDayGreeting_Night_010_Intro_002">I’ve never seen anything like this before...</string>
  <!-- Talking about NPC: Fletch -->
  <string name="MILBURN/IslandDayGreeting_Noon_010_Intro_000">Hmph.</string>
  <!-- Talking about NPC: Fletch -->
  <string name="MILBURN/IslandDayGreeting_Noon_010_Intro_001">I hate to admit it.</string>
  <!-- Talking about NPC: Fletch -->
  <string name="MILBURN/IslandDayGreeting_Noon_010_Intro_002">&lt;no&gt;But these “&lt;Snags&gt;” are actually very nice.</string>
  <!-- Talking about NPC: Fletch -->
  <string name="MILBURN/IslandDayGreeting_Noon_010_Intro_003">&lt;yes&gt;I will have to invest in some more of these.</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/RandomConvo_000_Intro_000">You know what I always say, &lt;PlayerName&gt;?</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/RandomConvo_000_Intro_001">&lt;yes&gt;You’ve got to speculate to accumulate.</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/RandomConvo_000_Intro_002">Remember that!</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/RandomConvo_001_Intro_000">You know what I always say, &lt;PlayerName&gt;?</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/RandomConvo_001_Intro_001">&lt;yes&gt;Diversify! Diversify! Diversify!</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/RandomConvo_001_Intro_002">Remember that!</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/RandomConvo_002_Intro_000">It’s important to shares, &lt;PlayerName&gt;</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/RandomConvo_002_Intro_001">&lt;haha&gt;I should know. I own them all!</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/RandomConvo_003_Intro_000">You know what I always say, &lt;PlayerName&gt;?</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/RandomConvo_003_Intro_001">&lt;yes&gt;There’s the one percent, and the won percent!</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/RandomConvo_003_Intro_002">&lt;proud&gt;Let me tell you, &lt;PlayerName&gt;, I always win.</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/RandomConvo_004_Intro_000">&lt;thinking&gt;If I had all the gold in the world, I would buy more gold with it, and then sell that gold for fat stacks of gold.</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/RandomConvo_004_Intro_001">&lt;thinking&gt;Hmph...</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/RandomConvo_004_Intro_002">&lt;haha&gt;I’d be a bullionaire!</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/RandomConvo_005_Intro_000">Counting money can be exhausting. &lt;sigh&gt;</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/RandomConvo_005_Intro_001">What?</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/RandomConvo_005_Intro_002">&lt;no&gt;There's no way I would pay someone to do that!</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/RandomConvo_005_Intro_003">&lt;pumped&gt;I've got to hold on to every single Dink I can.</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/RandomConvo_006_Intro_000">&lt;thinking&gt;I was visited in my sleep by three ghosts once.</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/RandomConvo_006_Intro_001">&lt;shocked&gt;They said they wanted to take me on a life changing journey!</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/RandomConvo_006_Intro_002">&lt;no&gt;Too bad for them that they couldn't afford my hourly rate, so I just went back to sleep.</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/RandomConvo_007_Intro_000">&lt;yes&gt;Hmph, things ran better back in &lt;SouthCity&gt;.</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/RandomConvo_007_Intro_001">People had more trust in banks back there.</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/RandomConvo_007_Intro_002">People just did what they were told!</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/RandomConvo_008_Intro_000">I’ll tell you what, back in &lt;SouthCity&gt; everyone knew who I was.</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/RandomConvo_008_Intro_001">&lt;proud&gt;I was constantly getting recognised.</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/RandomConvo_008_Intro_002">&lt;no&gt;Why, I could hardly walk down the street without being booed.</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/RandomConvo_009_Intro_000">&lt;thinking&gt;They say &lt;Dinks&gt; make the world go around...</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/RandomConvo_009_Intro_001">But go around where?</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/RandomConvo_009_Intro_002">How many?</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/RandomConvo_009_Intro_003">&lt;angry&gt;And, more importantly, what’s the world doing going around with my &lt;Dinks&gt;?</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/RandomConvo_010_Intro_000">&lt;no&gt;I don’t really have time to talk right now.</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/RandomConvo_010_Intro_001">&lt;yes&gt;Time is &lt;Dinks&gt; and my time is worth more &lt;Dinks&gt; than yours, &lt;PlayerName&gt;.</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/RandomConvo_011_Intro_000">&lt;yes&gt;Give a man a &lt;Dink&gt; and he’ll eat for a day.</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/RandomConvo_011_Intro_001">&lt;proud&gt;Give a man a million &lt;Dinks&gt; and that man will never work again!</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/RandomConvo_011_Intro_002">&lt;yes&gt;A very wise and true proverb that I live my life by, &lt;PlayerName&gt;.</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/RandomConvo_012_Intro_000">&lt;yes&gt;Although I do miss &lt;SouthCity&gt;, I think there's some incredible opportunities here on &lt;IslandName&gt;.</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/RandomConvo_012_Intro_001">&lt;glee&gt;A brand new market ripe for exploitation.</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/RandomConvo_012_Intro_002">&lt;shy&gt;Exploration, I mean exploration, of course.</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/RandomConvo_013_Intro_000">&lt;thinking&gt;Hmph, I'd love to cut costs at the bank...</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/RandomConvo_013_Intro_001">&lt;no&gt;But, I simply can't afford to lower my salary.</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/RandomConvo_014_Intro_000">&lt;proud&gt;Don't worry, your &lt;Dinks&gt; are safe with me!</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/RandomConvo_014_Intro_001">&lt;glee&gt;Plus, they have a boatload of other &lt;Dinks&gt; to play with.</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/RandomConvo_015_Intro_000">I started out with a small loan of 1,000,000 &lt;Dinks&gt; from my father.</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/RandomConvo_015_Intro_001">&lt;haha&gt;Hmph, and now, I run my own bank!</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/RandomConvo_015_Intro_002">&lt;shy&gt;I know, I know, I’m very humble.</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/RandomConvo_016_Intro_000">&lt;glee&gt;I love the rain.</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/RandomConvo_016_Intro_001">&lt;yes&gt;It's nature's way of giving my building a free wash.</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/RandomConvo_016_Intro_002">&lt;haha&gt;You just can't beat free!</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/RandomConvo_017_Intro_000">&lt;worried&gt;Try not to take out too many &lt;Dinks&gt; at once, it makes me sweat like crazy.</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/RandomConvo_017_Intro_001">&lt;shy&gt;Withdrawal symptoms are no joke.</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/RandomConvo_018_Intro_000">&lt;no&gt;I didn’t really need &lt;PermitPoints&gt; back in &lt;SouthCity&gt;.</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/RandomConvo_018_Intro_001">&lt;yes&gt;You don’t need a &lt;Licence&gt; to do anything if you just pay someone with a &lt;Licence&gt; to do it for you!</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/RandomConvo_019_Intro_000">&lt;no&gt;I never did eat &lt;BlobFish&gt;.</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/RandomConvo_019_Intro_001">&lt;shocked&gt;Why would I ever sully my taste buds on something that looks so ghastly!</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/RandomConvo_019_Intro_002">&lt;proud&gt;I would always import fine foods from other places!</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/RandomConvo_020_Intro_000">&lt;thinking&gt;I’ve seen you out there breaking rocks and chopping trees.</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/RandomConvo_020_Intro_001">Have you ever though of maybe paying someone else to do all that hard work for you?</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/RandomConvo_020_Intro_002">Hmph. I guess you can't afford that?</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/RandomConvo_021_Intro_000">&lt;thinking&gt;You know, &lt;PlayerName&gt;...</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/RandomConvo_021_Intro_001">&lt;thinking&gt;I never realised how much money you inject into the economy here on &lt;IslandName&gt;.</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/RandomConvo_021_Intro_002">&lt;shy&gt;Maybe you aren’t so bad after all?</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/RandomConvo_022_Intro_000">You know that famous saying, “A &lt;Dink&gt; in the bank is better than a &lt;Dink&gt; in the hand”?</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/RandomConvo_022_Option_000">I know it</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/RandomConvo_022_Option_001">That's not a saying.</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/RandomConvo_022_Response_000_000">&lt;proud&gt;I’m the one that came up with that saying.</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/RandomConvo_022_Response_000_001">&lt;angry&gt;And don't listen to anyone else who says they did!</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/RandomConvo_022_Response_001_000">&lt;angry&gt;How dare you!</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/RandomConvo_022_Response_001_001">&lt;proud&gt;I’m the one that came up with that saying.</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/RandomConvo_022_Response_001_002">&lt;angry&gt;I’ve been trying to settle a legal battle for years in regards to that!</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/RandomConvo_023_Intro_000">You know what I like about you, &lt;PlayerName&gt;?</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/RandomConvo_023_Intro_001">&lt;no&gt;You’re not great at anything. Not good, even.</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/RandomConvo_023_Intro_002">But you’re still out there, day after day.</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/RandomConvo_023_Intro_003">&lt;yes&gt;Just having a go. Giving it a shot.</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/RandomConvo_023_Intro_004">&lt;yes&gt;Marvellous.</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/RandomConvo_024_Intro_000">&lt;thinking&gt;Whenever I’m feeling down, I find it helps to imagine that somewhere out there, a lot of people are feeling a whole lot worse.</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/RandomConvo_024_Intro_001">&lt;proud&gt;With not nearly as many &lt;Dinks&gt;!</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/RandomConvo_024_Intro_002">&lt;haha&gt;It never fails to brighten my day.</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/RandomConvo_025_Intro_000">&lt;sigh&gt;Childhood was a difficult time for me.</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/RandomConvo_025_Intro_001">So much to learn, you see.
\nWhich bell to ring for afternoon tea?</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/RandomConvo_025_Intro_002">Which spoon to use for what?</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/RandomConvo_025_Intro_003">&lt;yes&gt;Oh, the servants tried their best, of course.</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/RandomConvo_025_Intro_004">&lt;no&gt;It was impossible to find good help.</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/RandomConvo_026_Intro_000">&lt;yes&gt;People in charge should stay in charge.</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/RandomConvo_026_Intro_001">&lt;thinking&gt;It’s so obvious, really.</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/RandomConvo_026_Intro_002">Experience, see.</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/RandomConvo_026_Intro_003">&lt;no&gt;Can’t beat it.</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/RandomConvo_027_Intro_000">&lt;no&gt;I feel like there are FAR too many resources here on &lt;IslandName&gt;!</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/RandomConvo_027_Intro_001">If everybody has everything they need, what’s the point of being rich?</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/RandomConvo_027_Intro_002">&lt;proud&gt;Hmph.</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/RandomConvo_027_Intro_003">&lt;thinking&gt;How will people know I’m better than them?</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/RandomConvo_028_Intro_000">Remember, &lt;PlayerName&gt;, if everybody can afford your services,</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/RandomConvo_028_Intro_001">&lt;pumped&gt;You aren’t charging enough.</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/RandomConvo_029_Intro_000">&lt;glee&gt;You’ll be happy to hear that I’ve reinforced the pockets of my suit.</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/RandomConvo_029_Intro_001">&lt;yes&gt;&lt;Dinks&gt; can be quite heavy, you know.</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/RandomConvo_029_Intro_002">&lt;proud&gt;No escapees on my watch!</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/RandomConvo_030_Intro_000">You know, you are almost tolariable sometimes, &lt;PlayerName&gt;.</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/RandomConvo_030_Intro_001">&lt;yes&gt;Especially when you are making a deposit into your account.</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/RandomConvo_031_Intro_000">Sometimes I can be a bit harsh on you, &lt;PlayerName&gt;.</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/RandomConvo_031_Intro_001">&lt;thinking&gt;You see, I’ve grown up knowing I’m better than everyone else.</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/RandomConvo_031_Intro_002">&lt;no&gt;I’ve got to remember it doesn’t mean everyone else is rubbish.</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/RandomConvo_032_Intro_000">What is that grotty old &lt;Journal&gt; you carry around all the time, anyway?</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/RandomConvo_032_Intro_001">&lt;haha&gt;If I were you I would spend a few &lt;Dinks&gt; to get a new one!</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/RandomConvo_032_Intro_002">&lt;no&gt;That looks like it's decades old!</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/RandomConvo_033_Intro_000">You know, &lt;PlayerName&gt;.</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/RandomConvo_033_Intro_001">&lt;yes&gt;I’ve got to say, you are always very helpful when it comes to fulfilling my requests.</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/RandomConvo_033_Intro_002">Luckily, I always reward you accordingly, so a thanks isn’t really required here, is it?</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/RandomConvo_034_Intro_000">If I had to guess, you might be the second wealthiest person on &lt;IslandName&gt;, &lt;PlayerName&gt;.</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/RandomConvo_034_Intro_001">&lt;proud&gt;Hmph, of course I’m including my future inheritance that I am owed...</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/RandomConvo_035_Intro_000">&lt;shy&gt;&lt;IslandName&gt; isn’t that bad after you spend a while here, I guess.</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/RandomConvo_035_Intro_001">&lt;no&gt;Oh, please, don’t get me wrong, &lt;PlayerName&gt;.</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/RandomConvo_035_Intro_002">&lt;proud&gt;As soon as I get the chance I’m going to return to my lovely abode back in &lt;SouthCity&gt;.</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/RandomConvo_035_Intro_003">&lt;yes&gt;I have an indoor swimming pool there you know.</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/RandomConvo_035_Intro_004">&lt;proud&gt;It’s full of &lt;Dinks&gt;!</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/TownMention_Level_001_Intro_000">&lt;proud&gt;Hmph, &lt;SouthCity&gt; is so much better than &lt;IslandName&gt;.</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/TownMention_Level_001_Intro_001">&lt;yes&gt;There are so many more people willing to put money into banks and the like.</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/TownMention_Level_002_Intro_000">Hmph, I must admit, &lt;IslandName&gt; is somewhat of an up and coming place to be.</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/TownMention_Level_002_Intro_001">&lt;thinking&gt;Maybe I should invest in some property here...</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/TownMention_Level_003_Intro_000">Hmph. &lt;IslandName&gt; sure has changed a lot since you got here, &lt;PlayerName&gt;.</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/TownMention_Level_003_Intro_001">&lt;shy&gt;Hmph, it’s definitely no &lt;SouthCity&gt;, but I guess it’s not all bad here.</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/TownMention_Level_004_Intro_000">&lt;thinking&gt;I remember when I constantly wanted to get off &lt;IslandName&gt;.</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/TownMention_Level_004_Intro_001">&lt;yes&gt;But it is actually very tolerable here.</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/TownMention_Level_004_Intro_002">&lt;no&gt;These days, I only occasionally want to escape this wretched place.</string>

  <!-- Talking about NPC: Fletch -->
  <string name="MILBURN/SkyFest_Noon_010_Intro_000">&lt;shocked&gt;You mean I’m expected to make my own &lt;Kite&gt;!?</string>
  <!-- Talking about NPC: Fletch -->
  <string name="MILBURN/SkyFest_Noon_010_Intro_001">&lt;no&gt;What kind of event is this?</string>
  <!-- Talking about NPC: Fletch -->
  <string name="MILBURN/SkyFest_Noon_010_Intro_002">&lt;pumped&gt;I’ll tell you, &lt;PlayerName&gt;.</string>

  <!-- Talking about Item: ADM -->
  <string name="MILBURN/Buy_ATM_Convo_Intro_000">Hmmph.</string>
  <!-- Talking about Item: ADM -->
  <string name="MILBURN/Buy_ATM_Convo_Intro_001">So that &lt;buyItemName&gt; has caught your eye?</string>
  <!-- Talking about Item: ADM -->
  <string name="MILBURN/Buy_ATM_Convo_Intro_002">&lt;yes&gt;It allows you to withdraw your funds from your account.</string>
  <!-- Talking about Item: ADM -->
  <string name="MILBURN/Buy_ATM_Convo_Intro_003">&lt;yes&gt;Even when the bank is closed.</string>
  <!-- Talking about Item: ADM -->
  <string name="MILBURN/Buy_ATM_Convo_Intro_004">However, you will still have to visit the branch to deposit.</string>
  <!-- Talking about Item: ADM -->
  <string name="MILBURN/Buy_ATM_Convo_Intro_005">It can be yours for the low price of &lt;buyItemPrice&gt;?</string>
  <!-- Talking about Item: ADM -->
  <string name="MILBURN/Buy_ATM_Convo_Option_000">I'll take it!</string>
  <!-- Talking about Item: ADM -->

  <!-- Said by Milburn talking to any NPC -->
  <string name="MILBURN/BackAndForthConvo_nightFallbacks_1_Line_0">It’s ridiculous what they are charging.</string>
  <!-- Said by any NPC talking to Milburn -->
  <string name="MILBURN/BackAndForthConvo_nightFallbacks_1_Line_1">I reckon it seems pretty fair.</string>
  <!-- Said by Milburn talking to any NPC -->
  <string name="MILBURN/BackAndForthConvo_nightFallbacks_2_Line_0">Out with it. Time is &lt;Dinks&gt;.</string>
  <!-- Said by any NPC talking to Milburn -->

  <!-- Said by any NPC talking to Milburn -->

  <string name="MILBURN/">&lt;proud&gt;Hmph, of course I’m including my future inheritance that I am owed...</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/JimmyWorkConvo_Intro_000">Welcome back, &lt;PlayerName&gt;.</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/JimmyWorkConvo_Intro_001">Are you here to talk business?</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/JimmyWorkConvo_Option_000">Want to buy anything?</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/JimmyWorkConvo_Option_001">Got any deals?</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/JimmyWorkConvo_Option_002">Nevermind.</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/JimmyWorkConvo_Response_000_000">&lt;yes&gt;Alright then. Just remember I only buy in bulk.</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/JimmyWorkConvo_Response_000_001">I won't take anything less than 50 of an item.</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/JimmyWorkConvo_Response_000_002">But I will pay double, just for you, &lt;PlayerName&gt;.</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/JimmyWorkConvo_Response_002_000">Have a great day.</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/LongConvo_001_Intro_000">I never wanted to come to this wretched place you know, &lt;PlayerName&gt;.</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/LongConvo_001_Intro_001">&lt;no&gt;My mother always said I had no ambition, no drive.</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/LongConvo_001_Intro_002">Well, when she died I was expecting to have all her &lt;Dinks&gt; you see?</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/LongConvo_001_Intro_003">Unfortunately she demanded that I get out of &lt;SouthCity&gt;.</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/LongConvo_001_Intro_004">&lt;no&gt;Can you believe she demanded that I go start a business if I wanted to inherit her money!</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/LongConvo_001_Intro_005">&lt;no&gt;Even in death, that woman is so selfish.</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/LongConvo_002_Intro_000">My family were some of the first to make it to &lt;SouthCity&gt; back when the world was going south.</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/LongConvo_002_Intro_001">We got in very early. I guess you could say we had first class tickets!</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/LongConvo_002_Intro_002">I’ve been told that things were very good before more and more riff-raff started turning up.</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/LongConvo_002_Intro_003">&lt;no&gt;Wanting to be fed, wanting a place to sleep and generally just wanting more than they could afford.</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/LongConvo_002_Intro_004">Luckily, my family kept our inheritance and passed it down generation to generation.</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/LongConvo_002_Intro_005">Hmph, nice to know that the rich stay rich, eh, &lt;PlayerName&gt;?</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/LongConvo_003_Intro_000">As soon as my obligations are met here on &lt;IslandName&gt; I will be leaving post haste.</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/LongConvo_003_Intro_001">&lt;no&gt;The people here are… too nice.</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/LongConvo_003_Intro_002">Everyone seems to get along.</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/LongConvo_003_Intro_003">Hmph. Give me &lt;SouthCity&gt; any day.</string>
  <string name="MILBURN/LongConvo_003_Intro_004">At least there, people know how I should be treated.</string>
