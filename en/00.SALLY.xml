  <string name="SALLY/RandomConvo_004_Intro_001">&lt;glee&gt;And just like clothes, the way you style it can show off your personality!</string>

  <string name="SALLY/RandomConvo_006_Intro_001">&lt;proud&gt;I haven't cut anyone's ear off or anything since I started visiting &lt;IslandName&gt;.</string>
  <string name="SALLY/RandomConvo_007_Intro_000">&lt;thinking&gt;Before I was a hairdresser I had a part-time job as a pet stylist.</string>
  <string name="SALLY/RandomConvo_007_Intro_001">&lt;glee&gt;It's where I learnt my best cuts and styles!</string>
  <string name="SALLY/RandomConvo_007_Intro_002">&lt;yes&gt;They’re amazing innovative styles, so nobody asks for them a second time.</string>
  <string name="SALLY/RandomConvo_008_Intro_000">Have you ever tried cutting topiaries?</string>

  <string name="SALLY/RandomConvo_008_Intro_002">&lt;haha&gt;It's wonderfully fun and the plants don't even complain when you mess it up!</string>
  <string name="SALLY/RandomConvo_009_Intro_000">&lt;yes&gt;I've had a lot of jobs before I settled on hairstylist.</string>
  <string name="SALLY/RandomConvo_009_Intro_001">&lt;yes&gt;My parents told me to do what I was good at.</string>
  <string name="SALLY/RandomConvo_009_Intro_002">&lt;proud&gt;But I think that's just too easy!</string>

  <string name="SALLY/RandomConvo_010_Intro_001">Maybe they could teach me a thing or two?</string>
  <string name="SALLY/RandomConvo_011_Intro_000">&lt;yes&gt;The best thing about hair is that it grows back, so we can always try again.</string>
  <string name="SALLY/RandomConvo_011_Intro_001">&lt;shy&gt;Not that we’ll need to! It’s just nice to have some backup options.</string>
  <string name="SALLY/RandomConvo_011_Intro_002">But, have you considered going bald, &lt;PlayerName&gt;?</string>
  <string name="SALLY/RandomConvo_012_Intro_000">&lt;proud&gt;I am, without a doubt, the absolute best hairdresser here on &lt;IslandName&gt;.</string>

  <string name="SALLY/RandomConvo_014_Intro_001">&lt;glee&gt;They’re such darlings.</string>
  <string name="SALLY/RandomConvo_015_Intro_000">&lt;pumped&gt;My whole life people have been trying to take sharp objects away from me, but look at me now!</string>

  <string name="SALLY/RandomConvo_015_Intro_002">&lt;dance&gt;Scissors forever!</string>
  <string name="SALLY/RandomConvo_015_Intro_003">&lt;shy&gt;I’m so, so sorry, &lt;PlayerName&gt;. I don’t know what came over me.</string>
  <string name="SALLY/RandomConvo_016_Intro_000">People back in &lt;SouthCity&gt; generally went for the boring haircuts.</string>
  <string name="SALLY/RandomConvo_016_Intro_001">&lt;yes&gt;So it's nice to be doing something different here on &lt;IslandName&gt;.</string>
  <string name="SALLY/RandomConvo_017_Intro_000">&lt;proud&gt;I’m the best at jigsaw puzzles.</string>

  <!-- Said by Sally talking to Clover -->
  <string name="SALLY/BackAndForthConvo_Clover_0_Line_2">I know my way around a pair of scissors, if that helps</string>
  <!-- Said by Clover talking to Sally -->
  <string name="SALLY/BackAndForthConvo_Clover_0_Line_3">Yeah, but then how would I get all this burning rage out of me, y’know?</string>

  <!-- Said by Irwin talking to Sally -->
  <string name="SALLY/BackAndForthConvo_Irwin_2_Line_1">A good night's rest and a morning walk does the trick, I reckon.</string>
  <!-- Said by Sally talking to Irwin -->
  <string name="SALLY/BackAndForthConvo_Irwin_2_Line_2">I try that, but I’m still so sleepy by lunchtime.</string>

  <!-- Said by Sally talking to Theodore -->
  <string name="SALLY/BackAndForthConvo_Theodore_2_Line_2">Really? I find it super relaxing.</string>
  <!-- Said by Theodore talking to Sally -->
  <string name="SALLY/BackAndForthConvo_Theodore_2_Line_3">Yeah, that’s how they get you. You think ‘Oh, that’s cute’</string>
  <!-- Said by Sally talking to Theodore -->
  <string name="SALLY/BackAndForthConvo_Theodore_2_Line_4">Awwww.</string>

  <!-- Said by Sally talking to Theodore -->
  <string name="SALLY/BackAndForthConvo_Theodore_2_Line_8">They couldn’t get you from behind the glass though, could they?</string>
  <!-- Said by Theodore talking to Sally -->
  <string name="SALLY/BackAndForthConvo_Theodore_2_Line_9">Maybe, maybe not. I’m not taking any chances.</string>
