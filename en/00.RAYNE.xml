  <!-- Said by Theodore talking to Rayne -->
  <string name="RAYNE/BackAndForthConvo_Theodore_2_Line_3">Why would they be doing that?</string>
  <!-- Said by Rayne talking to Theodore -->
  <string name="RAYNE/BackAndForthConvo_Theodore_2_Line_4">I guess I can’t blame them. Everything’s gotta eat something!</string>
  <!-- Said by Theodore talking to Rayne -->
  <string name="RAYNE/BackAndForthConvo_Theodore_2_Line_5">Oh. Um. Are you sure? I’ve made a terrible mistake.</string>

  <!-- Said by Rayne talking to Milburn -->
  <string name="RAYNE/BackAndForthConvo_Milburn_1_Line_2">It doesn’t like, cost anything to be nice.</string>
  <!-- Said by Milburn talking to Rayne -->
  <string name="RAYNE/BackAndForthConvo_Milburn_1_Line_3">Hmph. It doesn’t pay anything either!</string>

  <string name="RAYNE/LongConvo_001_Intro_000">Did you know, all the seeds I sell are from my own collection?</string>
  <string name="RAYNE/LongConvo_001_Intro_001">&lt;shy&gt;I started collecting the seeds when I was, like, just a little girl.</string>
  <string name="RAYNE/LongConvo_001_Intro_002">I would spend all the &lt;Dinks&gt; I had saved up and buy them wherever I could.</string>
  <string name="RAYNE/LongConvo_001_Intro_003">I didn’t have a lot of space on my family’s &lt;AirShip&gt;. So I could only grow certain plants at certain times.</string>
  <string name="RAYNE/LongConvo_001_Intro_004">I’ve always wanted some space to spread out, you know. Have a whole garden!</string>
  <string name="RAYNE/LongConvo_001_Intro_005">&lt;haha&gt;Even though I spent so much time in the air, I guess I, like, always wanted to be down here in the dirt and stuff.</string>
  <string name="RAYNE/LongConvo_001_Intro_006">That’s why I had to leave my family and stuff.</string>
  <string name="RAYNE/LongConvo_001_Intro_007">&lt;sigh&gt;Although, I miss them a lot, you know &lt;PlayerName&gt;.</string>
  <string name="RAYNE/LongConvo_002_Intro_000">&lt;sigh&gt;Hey &lt;PlayerName&gt;...</string>
  <string name="RAYNE/LongConvo_002_Intro_001">I’ve been kinda like, thinking about my family and stuff.</string>
  <string name="RAYNE/LongConvo_002_Intro_002">I didn’t leave them on the best of terms…</string>
  <string name="RAYNE/LongConvo_002_Intro_003">I guess you could say I kinda, like, ran away from them..</string>
  <string name="RAYNE/LongConvo_002_Intro_004">&lt;boohoo&gt;I didn’t even leave a note or anything. I just jumped out of the &lt;AirShip&gt; one night.</string>
  <string name="RAYNE/LongConvo_002_Intro_005">They didn’t understand that I wanted to stay in one place.</string>
  <string name="RAYNE/LongConvo_002_Intro_006">I just wanted to get to know some people, you know, make friends with someone and stuff.</string>
  <string name="RAYNE/LongConvo_002_Intro_007">&lt;pumped&gt; I do miss them, &lt;PlayerName&gt;.</string>
  <string name="RAYNE/LongConvo_002_Intro_008">But to be honest with you, coming to &lt;IslandName&gt; is, like, the most bonza thing that has ever happened to me.</string>
  <string name="RAYNE/LongConvo_002_Intro_009">I’ve gotten close to everyone here on the &lt;IslandName&gt;.</string>
  <string name="RAYNE/LongConvo_002_Intro_010">Especially you, &lt;PlayerName&gt;.</string>
  <string name="RAYNE/LongConvo_002_Intro_011">&lt;haha&gt;So, like, thanks for being my friend. My first friend!</string>
  <string name="RAYNE/LongConvo_003_Intro_000">&lt;PlayerName&gt;, I just wanted to thank you.</string>
  <string name="RAYNE/LongConvo_003_Intro_001">&lt;no&gt;Before I came to &lt;IslandName&gt; I’ve felt like I’ve never had a home.</string>
  <string name="RAYNE/LongConvo_003_Intro_002">&lt;shy&gt;I’ve never been able to, like, put down roots, so to say.</string>
  <string name="RAYNE/LongConvo_003_Intro_003">&lt;yes&gt;But thanks to you and everyone else here, &lt;IslandName&gt;, like, really feels like my home now.</string>
  <string name="RAYNE/LongConvo_003_Intro_004">&lt;thinking&gt;It snuck up on me so slowly that I guess I didn’t notice it and stuff.</string>
  <string name="RAYNE/LongConvo_003_Intro_005">&lt;shy&gt;So, yeah, like, thanks, &lt;PlayerName&gt;.</string>
  <string name="RAYNE/LongConvo_003_Intro_006">&lt;glee&gt;I’m so happy to be here on &lt;IslandName&gt;!</string>
  <string name="Npc0/Gossip_About_NPC_002_Intro_001">&lt;no&gt;They keep the birds away, but when I wave they never wave back.</string>
  <string name="Npc0/Introduction_000_Intro_002">&lt;thinking&gt;Although I can only sell them to people who have a &lt;FarmingLicence&gt;.</string>
  <string name="Npc0/Plant Shop Convo_Intro_000">Oh... hey.</string>
  <string name="Npc0/Plant Shop Convo_Intro_001">How can I help?</string>
  <string name="Npc0/RandomConvo_002_Intro_000">&lt;shy&gt;I, like, have a confession to make… I didn’t have a Farming Licence until recently…</string>
