  <!-- Talking about NPC: Theodore -->
  <string name="Npc13/BugCatchingCompConvo_NotInComp_Response_000_002">&lt;NPCName&gt; helped me write down the rules in it too if you don't know how to play.</string>
  <!-- Talking about NPC: Theodore -->
  <string name="Npc13/BugCatchingCompConvo_NotInComp_Response_001_000">The main rule is to catch as many bugs as you can today, before &lt;bugCompEndTime&gt;.</string>
  <!-- Talking about NPC: Theodore -->
  <string name="Npc13/BugCatchingCompConvo_NotInComp_Response_001_001">Once you've joined the &lt;bugComp&gt;, each bug you catch will get you some points.</string>

  <string name="Npc13/BackAndForthConvo_Rayne_0_Line_0">Have you ever tried to make a new plant?</string>
  <string name="Npc13/BackAndForthConvo_Rayne_0_Line_1">How would I do that?</string>
  <string name="Npc13/BackAndForthConvo_Rayne_0_Line_2">Perhaps you could splice the seeds?</string>
  <string name="Npc13/BackAndForthConvo_Rayne_0_Line_3">I could never do that!</string>
  <string name="Npc13/BackAndForthConvo_Rayne_0_Line_4">I do not understand…</string>
  <string name="Npc13/BackAndForthConvo_Rayne_0_Line_5">It would hurt the seeds!</string>
  <string name="Npc13/BackAndForthConvo_Rayne_1_Line_0">I require your assistance.</string>
  <string name="Npc13/BackAndForthConvo_Rayne_1_Line_1">Sure!</string>
  <string name="Npc13/BackAndForthConvo_Rayne_1_Line_2">Please stop bothering me when I am trying to work.</string>
  <string name="Npc13/BackAndForthConvo_Rayne_1_Line_3">I thought I was helping…</string>
  <string name="Npc13/BackAndForthConvo_Rayne_1_Line_4">You were not.</string>
  <string name="Npc13/BackAndForthConvo_Rayne_2_Line_0">What is your favourite plant?</string>
  <string name="Npc13/BackAndForthConvo_Rayne_2_Line_1">Like, it’s hard to pick one type…</string>
  <string name="Npc13/BackAndForthConvo_Rayne_2_Line_2">Type? I want to see the specific plant.</string>
  <string name="Npc13/BackAndForthConvo_Rayne_2_Line_3">I, like, love them all equally.</string>
  <string name="Npc13/BackAndForthConvo_Rayne_2_Line_4">Impossible.</string>
  <string name="Npc13/BackAndForthConvo_John_0_Line_0">Your tools are inferior to anything I can craft.</string>
  <string name="Npc13/BackAndForthConvo_John_0_Line_1">My tools are much cheaper though.</string>
  <string name="Npc13/BackAndForthConvo_John_0_Line_2">Yes they are.</string>
  <string name="Npc13/BackAndForthConvo_John_0_Line_3">But, they get the job done!</string>
  <string name="Npc13/BackAndForthConvo_John_0_Line_4">Yes they do. Slowly.</string>
  <string name="Npc13/BackAndForthConvo_John_0_Line_5">Why do I talk to you…</string>
  <string name="Npc13/BackAndForthConvo_John_1_Line_0">Are you interested in stocking some of my inventions?</string>
  <string name="Npc13/BackAndForthConvo_John_1_Line_1">That sounds great!</string>
  <string name="Npc13/BackAndForthConvo_John_1_Line_2">But I need to run my shop!</string>
  <string name="Npc13/BackAndForthConvo_John_1_Line_3">Then this business proposal is now moot.</string>
  <string name="Npc13/BackAndForthConvo_John_2_Line_0">Well, I have to send a lot back home…</string>
  <string name="Npc13/BackAndForthConvo_John_2_Line_1">I suppose someone back in South City is doing research for you?</string>
  <string name="Npc13/BackAndForthConvo_John_2_Line_2">You could say that…</string>
  <string name="Npc13/BackAndForthConvo_John_2_Line_3">Then I hope you share what you have learnt soon.</string>
  <string name="Npc13/BackAndForthConvo_Clover_0_Line_0">So this power can allow you to see the future?</string>
  <string name="Npc13/BackAndForthConvo_Clover_0_Line_1">Sometimes.</string>
  <string name="Npc13/BackAndForthConvo_Clover_0_Line_2">And how can I access this power?</string>
  <string name="Npc13/BackAndForthConvo_Clover_0_Line_3">You need to feel it, y’know?</string>
  <string name="Npc13/BackAndForthConvo_Clover_0_Line_4">Hmmm. Kinetic energy of some sort..</string>
  <string name="Npc13/BackAndForthConvo_Clover_0_Line_5">No. Not at all!</string>
  <string name="Npc13/BackAndForthConvo_Clover_1_Line_0">What do you mean my coat is drab?</string>
  <string name="Npc13/BackAndForthConvo_Clover_1_Line_1">You should come and see me.</string>
  <string name="Npc13/BackAndForthConvo_Clover_1_Line_2">I am seeing you now and my coat is just as functional as ever.</string>
  <string name="Npc13/BackAndForthConvo_Clover_1_Line_3">I could make you a nicer coat!</string>
  <string name="Npc13/BackAndForthConvo_Clover_1_Line_4">No thank you. This one is adequate.</string>
  <string name="Npc13/BackAndForthConvo_Clover_2_Line_0">I have an idea for a motorised machine for sewing.</string>
  <string name="Npc13/BackAndForthConvo_Clover_2_Line_1">Oh wow!</string>
  <string name="Npc13/BackAndForthConvo_Clover_2_Line_2">It will pull in a lot of power though.</string>
  <string name="Npc13/BackAndForthConvo_Clover_2_Line_3">Oh, but I don’t want it to mess with my chakras.</string>
  <string name="Npc13/BackAndForthConvo_Clover_2_Line_4">I see.</string>
  <string name="Npc13/BackAndForthConvo_Fletch_0_Line_0">No such license exists.</string>
  <string name="Npc13/BackAndForthConvo_Fletch_0_Line_1">Well it flamin’ should!</string>
  <string name="Npc13/BackAndForthConvo_Fletch_0_Line_2">That is not for me to decide.</string>
  <string name="Npc13/BackAndForthConvo_Fletch_0_Line_3">Just… be careful, will you?</string>
  <string name="Npc13/BackAndForthConvo_Fletch_0_Line_4">Fine. I will sell only four at a time.</string>
  <string name="Npc13/BackAndForthConvo_Fletch_1_Line_0">Do you remember much about the Shiny Discs?</string>
  <string name="Npc13/BackAndForthConvo_Fletch_1_Line_1">How old do you think I am?!</string>
  <string name="Npc13/BackAndForthConvo_Fletch_1_Line_2">Honestly, I could not begin to estimate.</string>
  <string name="Npc13/BackAndForthConvo_Fletch_1_Line_3">Well it was before my time, I’ll tell you what!</string>
  <string name="Npc13/BackAndForthConvo_Fletch_2_Line_0">Did your father ever venture into the deep mines?</string>
  <string name="Npc13/BackAndForthConvo_Fletch_2_Line_1">Oh, my father went everywhere, I’ll tell you what!</string>
  <string name="Npc13/BackAndForthConvo_Fletch_2_Line_2">Then perhaps you would answer a few questions?</string>
  <string name="Npc13/BackAndForthConvo_Fletch_2_Line_3">Sure, how long you got?</string>
  <string name="Npc13/BackAndForthConvo_Irwin_0_Line_0">Have you performed any experiments on your creatures?</string>
  <string name="Npc13/BackAndForthConvo_Irwin_0_Line_1">Um… no? What?</string>
  <string name="Npc13/BackAndForthConvo_Irwin_0_Line_2">You could make them stronger, faster, better!</string>
  <string name="Npc13/BackAndForthConvo_Irwin_0_Line_3">I think they’re fine just the way they are, thanks.</string>
  <string name="Npc13/BackAndForthConvo_Irwin_1_Line_0">But with the right upgrades...</string>
  <string name="Npc13/BackAndForthConvo_Irwin_1_Line_1">I heard you, I’m just not interested, mate.</string>
  <string name="Npc13/BackAndForthConvo_Irwin_1_Line_2">Think of the possibilities!</string>
  <string name="Npc13/BackAndForthConvo_Irwin_1_Line_3">Just leave nature alone, yeah?</string>
  <string name="Npc13/BackAndForthConvo_Irwin_2_Line_0">Does the smell not bother you?</string>
  <string name="Npc13/BackAndForthConvo_Irwin_2_Line_1">A little, but you’re not that bad, mate!</string>
  <string name="Npc13/BackAndForthConvo_Irwin_2_Line_2">I am speaking of your creatures.</string>
  <string name="Npc13/BackAndForthConvo_Irwin_2_Line_3">Oh, maybe. Some of them have really sensitive noses!</string>
  <string name="Npc13/BackAndForthConvo_Sally_0_Line_0">Have you ever considered a different field?</string>
  <string name="Npc13/BackAndForthConvo_Sally_0_Line_1">Further north, you mean?</string>
  <string name="Npc13/BackAndForthConvo_Sally_0_Line_2">I mean some other occupation.</string>
  <string name="Npc13/BackAndForthConvo_Sally_0_Line_3">Oh. All the time! But what about my customers?</string>
  <string name="Npc13/BackAndForthConvo_Sally_0_Line_4">I believe they would survive.</string>
  <string name="Npc13/BackAndForthConvo_Sally_1_Line_0">I spent yesterday arranging my instruments.</string>
  <string name="Npc13/BackAndForthConvo_Sally_1_Line_1">Is that why you cancelled your appointment?</string>
  <string name="Npc13/BackAndForthConvo_Sally_1_Line_2">I did not make an appointment.</string>
  <string name="Npc13/BackAndForthConvo_Sally_1_Line_3">I’m free tomorrow, my client list is pretty short.</string>
  <string name="Npc13/BackAndForthConvo_Sally_1_Line_4">Of that, I am certain.</string>
  <string name="Npc13/BackAndForthConvo_Sally_2_Line_0">Have you considered adding restraints to your chair?</string>
  <string name="Npc13/BackAndForthConvo_Sally_2_Line_1">I don’t think it’s going to go anywhere.</string>
  <string name="Npc13/BackAndForthConvo_Sally_2_Line_2">I was thinking of your customers.</string>
  <string name="Npc13/BackAndForthConvo_Sally_2_Line_3">Oh, might be an idea, then. Safety first!</string>
  <string name="Npc13/BackAndForthConvo_Theodore_0_Line_0">What will you do when your collection is complete?</string>
  <string name="Npc13/BackAndForthConvo_Theodore_0_Line_1">Categorization and filing!</string>
  <string name="Npc13/BackAndForthConvo_Theodore_0_Line_2">Of course, but what then?</string>
  <string name="Npc13/BackAndForthConvo_Theodore_0_Line_3">Re-categorization and re-filing!</string>
  <string name="Npc13/BackAndForthConvo_Theodore_1_Line_0">Do you dissect your specimens?</string>
  <string name="Npc13/BackAndForthConvo_Theodore_1_Line_1">Oh, no! I could never do that!</string>
  <string name="Npc13/BackAndForthConvo_Theodore_1_Line_2">Then you are missing out on so much knowledge!</string>
  <string name="Npc13/BackAndForthConvo_Theodore_1_Line_3">I think um, maybe that’s okay?</string>
  <string name="Npc13/BackAndForthConvo_Theodore_2_Line_0">How did you collect all of your specimens?</string>
  <string name="Npc13/BackAndForthConvo_Theodore_2_Line_1">Oh! &lt;PlayerName&gt; has been helping.</string>
  <string name="Npc13/BackAndForthConvo_Theodore_2_Line_2">What a remarkable coincidence.</string>
  <string name="Npc13/BackAndForthConvo_Theodore_2_Line_3">Yeah, they’ve been really helpful!</string>
  <string name="Npc13/BackAndForthConvo_Milburn_0_Line_0">If all your Dinks could buy infinite knowledge, would you part with them?</string>
  <string name="Npc13/BackAndForthConvo_Milburn_0_Line_1">Hmph. Certainly not.</string>
  <string name="Npc13/BackAndForthConvo_Milburn_0_Line_2">But you would know everything.</string>
  <string name="Npc13/BackAndForthConvo_Milburn_0_Line_3">If I need something done, I would simply pay someone.</string>
  <string name="Npc13/BackAndForthConvo_Milburn_1_Line_0">&lt;IslandName&gt; is amazing for research.</string>
  <string name="Npc13/BackAndForthConvo_Milburn_1_Line_1">I wouldn’t call a place crawling with critters amazing.</string>
  <string name="Npc13/BackAndForthConvo_Milburn_1_Line_2">But you can play with the very laws of nature here!</string>
  <string name="Npc13/BackAndForthConvo_Milburn_1_Line_3">If there were any laws I would have started suing long ago.</string>
  <string name="Npc13/BackAndForthConvo_Milburn_2_Line_0">I am developing a machine that can turn tin into gold</string>
  <string name="Npc13/BackAndForthConvo_Milburn_2_Line_1">If you need someone to fund your research, talk to me.</string>
  <string name="Npc13/BackAndForthConvo_Milburn_2_Line_2">Now that you mention it, I do require a large sum of &lt;Dinks&gt;.</string>
