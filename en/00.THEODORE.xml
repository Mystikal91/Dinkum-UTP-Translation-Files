  <string name="THEODORE/AllItemsAlreadyDonated_Intro_001">I'll just return this to you.</string>

  <string name="THEODORE/CompleteRequest_000_Intro_001">&lt;shy&gt;I would shake your hand in thanks, but that might be inappropriate.</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/CompleteRequest_000_Intro_002">Instead, I will give you this.</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/EmptyNoPhoto_Intro_000">That's one of our empty frames. It's a shame no one has donated a photo to place in it.</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/EmptyWithPhoto_Intro_000">That's one of our empty frames.</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/EmptyWithPhoto_Intro_001">Oh! Do you have a photo we could put here?</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/EmptyWithPhoto_Option_000">Yes!</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/EmptyWithPhoto_Option_001">No.</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/EmptyWithPhoto_Response_000_000">Great! Show me what you want to place here.</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/EmptyWithPhoto_Response_001_000">Well, if you take a great photo you want to show off. Please bring it in!</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/FullPhotoNoPhoto_Intro_000">Oh! What a wonderful photo that is!</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/FullPhotoNoPhoto_Intro_002">I'm quite fond of it to be honest! &lt;haha&gt;</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/FullPhotoWithPhoto_Intro_000">Oh! What a wonderful photo that is!</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/FullPhotoWithPhoto_Intro_002">If you have another photo to you want to place here let me know!</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/FullPhotoWithPhoto_Option_000">I have a different photo!</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/FullPhotoWithPhoto_Option_001">No thanks.</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/FullPhotoWithPhoto_Response_000_000">Great! We're always looking for new exhibits.</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/FullPhotoWithPhoto_Response_001_000">Phew. I'm quite fond of this one.</string>

  <!-- Talking about NPC: Fletch -->
  <string name="THEODORE/Introduction_009_Intro_003">&lt;glee&gt;I'd love to open a museum here on &lt;IslandName&gt;.</string>
  <!-- Talking about NPC: Fletch -->
  <string name="THEODORE/Introduction_009_Intro_004">We could fill it with all the interesting things found here on &lt;IslandName&gt;!</string>
  <!-- Talking about NPC: Fletch -->
  <string name="THEODORE/Introduction_009_Intro_005">So please speak to &lt;NPCName&gt; about building the museum as soon as possible!</string>
  <!-- Talking about NPC: Fletch -->
  <string name="THEODORE/IslandDayGreeting_AfterNoon_009_Intro_000">I think I’m going to write a paper about &lt;IslandDay&gt; and why it’s so good.</string>
  <!-- Talking about NPC: Fletch -->
  <string name="THEODORE/IslandDayGreeting_AfterNoon_009_Intro_001">&lt;thinking&gt;Maybe that’s the surprise &lt;NPCName&gt; has for us tonight!</string>
  <!-- Talking about NPC: Fletch -->

  <string name="THEODORE/IslandDayGreeting_Morning_009_Intro_001">&lt;no&gt;I’m not even going to step foot into the Museum today.</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/IslandDayGreeting_Morning_009_Intro_002">&lt;shy&gt;I’ve been told to relax and take it easy for &lt;IslandDay&gt;.</string>
  <!-- Talking about NPC: Fletch -->
  <string name="THEODORE/IslandDayGreeting_Night_009_Intro_000">Oh my!</string>
  <!-- Talking about NPC: Fletch -->
  <string name="THEODORE/IslandDayGreeting_Night_009_Intro_001">The sky!</string>
  <!-- Talking about NPC: Fletch -->
  <string name="THEODORE/IslandDayGreeting_Night_009_Intro_002">&lt;yes&gt;It’s absolutely incredible.</string>
  <!-- Talking about NPC: Fletch -->
  <string name="THEODORE/IslandDayGreeting_Night_009_Intro_003">I’ve never seen something so amazing.</string>
  <!-- Talking about NPC: Fletch -->
  <string name="THEODORE/IslandDayGreeting_Night_009_Intro_004">Are you seeing this, &lt;PlayerName&gt;?</string>
  <!-- Talking about NPC: Fletch -->
  <string name="THEODORE/IslandDayGreeting_Noon_009_Intro_000">&lt;NPCName&gt; has outdone herself.</string>
  <!-- Talking about NPC: Fletch -->
  <string name="THEODORE/IslandDayGreeting_Noon_009_Intro_001">&lt;yes&gt;This is the best &lt;Snag&gt; I’ve ever had.</string>
  <!-- Talking about NPC: Fletch -->
  <string name="THEODORE/IslandDayGreeting_Noon_009_Intro_002">Part of me wants to put what’s left of my &lt;Snag&gt; into an exhibit, just to save it for later.</string>
  <!-- Talking about NPC: Fletch -->
  <string name="THEODORE/IslandDayGreeting_Noon_009_Intro_003">&lt;haha&gt;But it’s too tasty.</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/ItemNotNeeded_Intro_000">Hmmmm... The museum isn't really looking for this kind of thing.</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/ItemNotNeeded_Intro_001">Our collection include, fish, bugs and relics. If there are any other items you don't want, maybe consider selling them?</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/ItemNotNeeded_Intro_002">Thanks!</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/MultipleDonateNoDoubles_Intro_000">&lt;shocked&gt;Oh my!</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/MultipleDonateNoDoubles_Intro_001">&lt;shy&gt;I see you have quite a few new amazing specimens not yet in our museum!</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/MultipleDonateNoDoubles_Intro_002">Would you be willing to donate all of these?</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/MultipleDonateNoDoubles_Option_000">Take them!</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/MultipleDonateNoDoubles_Option_001">Actually...</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/MultipleDonateNoDoubles_Response_000_000">&lt;glee&gt;Your generosity is outstanding!</string>

  <string name="THEODORE/MultipleDonateWithDoubles_Response_000_001">I only require one of each specimen, so I’ll return these other ones to you.</string>

  <string name="THEODORE/MultipleDonateWithDoubles_Response_001_000">Oh, I'll give these back then.</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/MultipleDonateWithDoubles_Response_001_001">If you change your mind, don't hesitate to come back.</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/MuseumKeeperConvo_Intro_000">Welcome to the museum!</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/MuseumKeeperConvo_Intro_001">What can I do for you?</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/MuseumKeeperConvo_Option_000">I have a donation.</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/MuseumKeeperConvo_Option_001">I want to chat.</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/MuseumKeeperConvo_Option_002">Nevermind.</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/MuseumKeeperConvo_Response_000_000">OH! What have you brought me?</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/MuseumKeeperConvo_Response_002_000">Please, have a look around.</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/NoItemsGiven_Intro_000">Oh, nothing to donate then? That's fine!</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/NoItemsGiven_Intro_001">&lt;sigh&gt;Although you did get my hopes up...</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/NonLocalEmpty_Intro_000">Oh, that's an empty frame.</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/NonLocalEmpty_Intro_001">&lt;glee&gt;We actually encourage locals to donate their own photos to display here!</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/NonLocalPicture_Intro_000">Oh! What a wonderful photo that is!</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/NonLocalPicture_Intro_002">The photographer is very talented!</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/RandomConvo_000_Intro_000">&lt;thinking&gt;Museums are very important for society.</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/RandomConvo_000_Intro_001">Imagine if we just kept all the old stuff where we found it?</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/RandomConvo_000_Intro_002">&lt;worried&gt;It would be all over the place!</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/RandomConvo_000_Intro_003">&lt;shocked&gt;Chaos!</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/RandomConvo_001_Intro_000">&lt;yes&gt;I’ve really been enjoying documenting all the new species on this island.</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/RandomConvo_001_Intro_001">&lt;glee&gt;To tell you the truth though, filing the documentation is nearly as enjoyable!</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/RandomConvo_002_Intro_000">&lt;worried&gt;Fish and bugs are very interesting, but I really don't like touching either...</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/RandomConvo_002_Intro_001">&lt;yes&gt;That’s fine though.</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/RandomConvo_002_Intro_002">&lt;proud&gt;After all, things in a museum are for looking at, not touching.</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/RandomConvo_003_Intro_000">&lt;thinking&gt;I’ve been wondering if there could be a way to catalogue air?</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/RandomConvo_003_Intro_001">Would you be interested in seeing an air exhibit, &lt;PlayerName&gt;?</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/RandomConvo_003_Option_000">Oh yeah!</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/RandomConvo_003_Option_001">Not Really</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/RandomConvo_003_Response_000_000">&lt;glee&gt; See, I had a feeling you were a fellow air-head!</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/RandomConvo_003_Response_000_001">I’ll ask around town and see if I can find some more people who are interested! &lt;glee&gt;</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/RandomConvo_003_Response_001_000">&lt;sigh&gt;
\nAh, that’s a shame. I’ve already collected a bunch of specimens in some jars...</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/RandomConvo_004_Intro_000">&lt;thinking&gt;Paperwork can be very time consuming.</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/RandomConvo_004_Intro_001">&lt;haha&gt;But they say time flies when you are having fun!</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/RandomConvo_005_Intro_000">&lt;yes&gt;If you ever take a great photo and you want to show it off, please come and display it in the museum.</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/RandomConvo_005_Intro_001">&lt;yes&gt;Don't worry, I will fill out the required forms for you!</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/RandomConvo_005_Intro_002">&lt;glee&gt;It would be my absolute pleasure!</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/RandomConvo_006_Intro_000">&lt;proud&gt;It’s so great to have a one stop shop to look at all the interesting stuff around here.</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/RandomConvo_006_Intro_001">What?</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/RandomConvo_006_Intro_002">&lt;shocked&gt;John’s Goods?</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/RandomConvo_006_Intro_003">&lt;no&gt;No, no, no.</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/RandomConvo_006_Intro_004">&lt;angry&gt;I meant the museum!</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/RandomConvo_007_Intro_000">&lt;glee&gt;There are so many new species to study here on &lt;IslandName&gt;!</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/RandomConvo_007_Intro_001">&lt;worried&gt; Oh no!</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/RandomConvo_007_Intro_002">&lt;no&gt;I don’t mean I’m going to cut them open!</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/RandomConvo_007_Intro_003">&lt;proud&gt;Here at the &lt;IslandName&gt; museum we only study by observing!</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/RandomConvo_008_Intro_000">&lt;thinking&gt;Imagine if we could take everything on &lt;IslandName&gt; and put it in a museum!</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/RandomConvo_008_Intro_001">&lt;proud&gt;That way, when people wanted to see a certain thing, they could just make their way to that wing!</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/RandomConvo_009_Intro_000">Studying things is just my job.</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/RandomConvo_009_Intro_001">&lt;yes&gt;I have plenty of other hobbies.</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/RandomConvo_009_Intro_002">&lt;glee&gt;For example, in my spare time I like to talk about all the things I’ve been studying.</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/RandomConvo_010_Intro_000">&lt;thinking&gt;I think one day we’ll see a Museum of Museums.</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/RandomConvo_010_Intro_001">&lt;yes&gt;Truly the pinnacle of society.</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/RandomConvo_010_Intro_002">All that knowledge, all those exhibits, all that paperwork!</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/RandomConvo_010_Intro_003">&lt;glee&gt;So beautiful.</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/RandomConvo_011_Intro_000">&lt;thinking&gt;I'd love to experience some more travelling one day.</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/RandomConvo_011_Intro_001">&lt;no&gt;As long as I don't have to actually go anywhere else, of course.</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/RandomConvo_011_Intro_002">&lt;pumped&gt;We could get exhibits from all over the world, and bring them right to &lt;IslandName&gt;!</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/RandomConvo_012_Intro_000">&lt;no&gt;I don’t go outside too much.</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/RandomConvo_012_Intro_001">&lt;worried&gt;There’s not enough order out there so it can get a bit overwhelming.</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/RandomConvo_012_Intro_002">&lt;worried&gt;All the plants and people and animals are just going around doing whatever they want, all over the place!</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/RandomConvo_012_Intro_003">&lt;shocked&gt;Chaos!</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/RandomConvo_013_Intro_000">&lt;thinking&gt;There’s so many different ways to organise things and group them together.</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/RandomConvo_013_Intro_001">&lt;yes&gt;Playing around with them can be exciting.</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/RandomConvo_013_Intro_002">&lt;pumped&gt;Sometimes I’ll go around and rearrange everything alphabetically, then by height, and sometimes even by smell!</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/RandomConvo_013_Intro_003">&lt;yes&gt;That last one is really easy to do, because everything smells like disinfectant, like it should.</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/RandomConvo_014_Intro_000">&lt;shy&gt;Sometimes I like to climb into an empty case and pretend I’M the exhibit.</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/RandomConvo_014_Intro_001">&lt;haha&gt;I’m a perfect candidate too, because I never try and escape.</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/RandomConvo_015_Intro_000">&lt;shy&gt;Sometimes I stand really really still and pretend I’m a statue...</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/RandomConvo_015_Intro_001">&lt;haha&gt;It makes me feel marble-ous!</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/RandomConvo_015_Intro_002">Just a little museum humour for you, &lt;PlayerName&gt;.</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/RandomConvo_016_Intro_000">&lt;thinking&gt;It must be nice to be getting watched all day.</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/RandomConvo_016_Intro_001">&lt;worried&gt;I don’t think I could handle the attention though.</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/RandomConvo_016_Intro_002">&lt;thinking&gt;Though, maybe if people formed an orderly queue it wouldn’t freak me out so much?</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/RandomConvo_017_Intro_000">&lt;yes&gt;I’m a huge fan of music.</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/RandomConvo_017_Intro_001">&lt;no&gt;I don’t listen to it, of course, it’s far too noisy.</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/RandomConvo_017_Intro_002">But there’s so many different ways to catalogue and arrange it.</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/RandomConvo_017_Intro_003">&lt;thinking&gt;You can organise by artist, genre, length, beats per minute…</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/RandomConvo_017_Intro_004">&lt;glee&gt;So many possibilities!</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/RandomConvo_018_Intro_000">&lt;glee&gt;What a beautiful day it is!</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/RandomConvo_018_Intro_001">&lt;yes&gt;Perfect weather to be indoors and studying!</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/RandomConvo_019_Intro_000">&lt;glee&gt;I just love the smell of fresh paper.</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/RandomConvo_019_Intro_001">&lt;yes&gt;All neatly arranged, lined up and ready for work.</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/RandomConvo_019_Intro_002">&lt;pumped&gt;Sometimes I feel bad writing on it, but we're doing really important work here.</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/RandomConvo_019_Intro_003">&lt;yes&gt;So its all worth it!</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/RandomConvo_020_Intro_000">What’s the point of anything happening if nobody is there to record it?</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/RandomConvo_020_Intro_001">&lt;yes&gt;Hey, &lt;PlayerName&gt;, if a tree falls in the woods, please be sure to let me know.</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/Thank you_Intro_000">Thank you! It looks great up here doesn't it?</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/allItemsAreNew_Intro_000">&lt;shocked&gt;Oh my! A &lt;donationName&gt;!</string>

  <!-- Talking about NPC: Fletch -->

  <!-- Talking about NPC: Fletch -->
  <string name="THEODORE/SkyFest_Noon_009_Intro_002">&lt;shy&gt;That way I wasn’t required to share any of the equipment.</string>
  <!-- Talking about NPC: Fletch -->
  <string name="THEODORE/SkyFest_Noon_009_Intro_003">&lt;shy&gt;I just prefer to not share things like that.</string>

  <string name="THEODORE/BackAndForthConvo_Rayne_0_Line_1">How would I do that?</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/BackAndForthConvo_Rayne_0_Line_2">Perhaps you could splice the seeds?</string>

  <string name="THEODORE/BackAndForthConvo_Rayne_1_Line_1">Sure!</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/BackAndForthConvo_Rayne_1_Line_2">Please stop bothering me when I am trying to work.</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/BackAndForthConvo_Rayne_1_Line_3">I thought I was helping…</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/BackAndForthConvo_Rayne_1_Line_4">You were not.</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/BackAndForthConvo_Rayne_2_Line_0">What is your favourite plant?</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/BackAndForthConvo_Rayne_2_Line_1">Like, it’s hard to pick one type…</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/BackAndForthConvo_Rayne_2_Line_2">Type? I want to see the specific plant.</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/BackAndForthConvo_Rayne_2_Line_3">I, like, love them all equally.</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/BackAndForthConvo_Rayne_2_Line_4">Impossible.</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/BackAndForthConvo_John_0_Line_0">Your tools are inferior to anything I can craft.</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/BackAndForthConvo_John_0_Line_1">My tools are much cheaper though.</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/BackAndForthConvo_John_0_Line_2">Yes they are.</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/BackAndForthConvo_John_0_Line_3">But, they get the job done!</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/BackAndForthConvo_John_0_Line_4">Yes they do. Slowly.</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/BackAndForthConvo_John_0_Line_5">Why do I talk to you…</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/BackAndForthConvo_John_1_Line_0">Are you interested in stocking some of my inventions?</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/BackAndForthConvo_John_1_Line_1">That sounds great!</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/BackAndForthConvo_John_1_Line_2">But I need to run my shop!</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/BackAndForthConvo_John_1_Line_3">Then this business proposal is now moot.</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/BackAndForthConvo_John_2_Line_0">Well, I have to send a lot back home…</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/BackAndForthConvo_John_2_Line_1">I suppose someone back in South City is doing research for you?</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/BackAndForthConvo_John_2_Line_2">You could say that…</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/BackAndForthConvo_John_2_Line_3">Then I hope you share what you have learnt soon.</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/BackAndForthConvo_Clover_0_Line_0">So this power can allow you to see the future?</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/BackAndForthConvo_Clover_0_Line_1">Sometimes.</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/BackAndForthConvo_Clover_0_Line_2">And how can I access this power?</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/BackAndForthConvo_Clover_0_Line_3">You need to feel it, y’know?</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/BackAndForthConvo_Clover_0_Line_4">Hmmm. Kinetic energy of some sort..</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/BackAndForthConvo_Clover_0_Line_5">No. Not at all!</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/BackAndForthConvo_Clover_1_Line_0">What do you mean my coat is drab?</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/BackAndForthConvo_Clover_1_Line_1">You should come and see me.</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/BackAndForthConvo_Clover_1_Line_2">I am seeing you now and my coat is just as functional as ever.</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/BackAndForthConvo_Clover_1_Line_3">I could make you a nicer coat!</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/BackAndForthConvo_Clover_1_Line_4">No thank you. This one is adequate.</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/BackAndForthConvo_Clover_2_Line_0">I have an idea for a motorised machine for sewing.</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/BackAndForthConvo_Clover_2_Line_1">Oh wow!</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/BackAndForthConvo_Clover_2_Line_2">It will pull in a lot of power though.</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/BackAndForthConvo_Clover_2_Line_3">Oh, but I don’t want it to mess with my chakras.</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/BackAndForthConvo_Clover_2_Line_4">I see.</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/BackAndForthConvo_Fletch_0_Line_0">No such license exists.</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/BackAndForthConvo_Fletch_0_Line_1">Well it flamin’ should!</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/BackAndForthConvo_Fletch_0_Line_2">That is not for me to decide.</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/BackAndForthConvo_Fletch_0_Line_3">Just… be careful, will you?</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/BackAndForthConvo_Fletch_0_Line_4">Fine. I will sell only four at a time.</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/BackAndForthConvo_Fletch_1_Line_0">Do you remember much about the Shiny Discs?</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/BackAndForthConvo_Fletch_1_Line_1">How old do you think I am?!</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/BackAndForthConvo_Fletch_1_Line_2">Honestly, I could not begin to estimate.</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/BackAndForthConvo_Fletch_1_Line_3">Well it was before my time, I’ll tell you what!</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/BackAndForthConvo_Fletch_2_Line_0">Did your father ever venture into the deep mines?</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/BackAndForthConvo_Fletch_2_Line_1">Oh, my father went everywhere, I’ll tell you what!</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/BackAndForthConvo_Fletch_2_Line_2">Then perhaps you would answer a few questions?</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/BackAndForthConvo_Fletch_2_Line_3">Sure, how long you got?</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/BackAndForthConvo_Irwin_0_Line_0">Have you performed any experiments on your creatures?</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/BackAndForthConvo_Irwin_0_Line_1">Um… no? What?</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/BackAndForthConvo_Irwin_0_Line_2">You could make them stronger, faster, better!</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/BackAndForthConvo_Irwin_0_Line_3">I think they’re fine just the way they are, thanks.</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/BackAndForthConvo_Irwin_1_Line_0">But with the right upgrades...</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/BackAndForthConvo_Irwin_1_Line_1">I heard you, I’m just not interested, mate.</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/BackAndForthConvo_Irwin_1_Line_2">Think of the possibilities!</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/BackAndForthConvo_Irwin_1_Line_3">Just leave nature alone, yeah?</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/BackAndForthConvo_Irwin_2_Line_0">Does the smell not bother you?</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/BackAndForthConvo_Irwin_2_Line_1">A little, but you’re not that bad, mate!</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/BackAndForthConvo_Irwin_2_Line_2">I am speaking of your creatures.</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/BackAndForthConvo_Irwin_2_Line_3">Oh, maybe. Some of them have really sensitive noses!</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/BackAndForthConvo_Sally_0_Line_0">Have you ever considered a different field?</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/BackAndForthConvo_Sally_0_Line_1">Further north, you mean?</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/BackAndForthConvo_Sally_0_Line_2">I mean some other occupation.</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/BackAndForthConvo_Sally_0_Line_3">Oh. All the time! But what about my customers?</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/BackAndForthConvo_Sally_0_Line_4">I believe they would survive.</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/BackAndForthConvo_Sally_1_Line_0">I spent yesterday arranging my instruments.</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/BackAndForthConvo_Sally_1_Line_1">Is that why you cancelled your appointment?</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/BackAndForthConvo_Sally_1_Line_2">I did not make an appointment.</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/BackAndForthConvo_Sally_1_Line_3">I’m free tomorrow, my client list is pretty short.</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/BackAndForthConvo_Sally_1_Line_4">Of that, I am certain.</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/BackAndForthConvo_Sally_2_Line_0">Have you considered adding restraints to your chair?</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/BackAndForthConvo_Sally_2_Line_1">I don’t think it’s going to go anywhere.</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/BackAndForthConvo_Sally_2_Line_2">I was thinking of your customers.</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/BackAndForthConvo_Sally_2_Line_3">Oh, might be an idea, then. Safety first!</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/BackAndForthConvo_Theodore_0_Line_0">What will you do when your collection is complete?</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/BackAndForthConvo_Theodore_0_Line_1">Categorization and filing!</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/BackAndForthConvo_Theodore_0_Line_2">Of course, but what then?</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/BackAndForthConvo_Theodore_0_Line_3">Re-categorization and re-filing!</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/BackAndForthConvo_Theodore_1_Line_0">Do you dissect your specimens?</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/BackAndForthConvo_Theodore_1_Line_1">Oh, no! I could never do that!</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/BackAndForthConvo_Theodore_1_Line_2">Then you are missing out on so much knowledge!</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/BackAndForthConvo_Theodore_1_Line_3">I think um, maybe that’s okay?</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/BackAndForthConvo_Theodore_2_Line_0">How did you collect all of your specimens?</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/BackAndForthConvo_Theodore_2_Line_1">Oh! &lt;PlayerName&gt; has been helping.</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/BackAndForthConvo_Theodore_2_Line_2">What a remarkable coincidence.</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/BackAndForthConvo_Theodore_2_Line_3">Yeah, they’ve been really helpful!</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/BackAndForthConvo_Milburn_0_Line_0">If all your Dinks could buy infinite knowledge, would you part with them?</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/BackAndForthConvo_Milburn_0_Line_1">Hmph. Certainly not.</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/BackAndForthConvo_Milburn_0_Line_2">But you would know everything.</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/BackAndForthConvo_Milburn_0_Line_3">If I need something done, I would simply pay someone.</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/BackAndForthConvo_Milburn_1_Line_0">&lt;IslandName&gt; is amazing for research.</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/BackAndForthConvo_Milburn_1_Line_1">I wouldn’t call a place crawling with critters amazing.</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/BackAndForthConvo_Milburn_1_Line_2">But you can play with the very laws of nature here!</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/BackAndForthConvo_Milburn_1_Line_3">If there were any laws I would have started suing long ago.</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/BackAndForthConvo_Milburn_2_Line_0">I am developing a machine that can turn tin into gold</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/BackAndForthConvo_Milburn_2_Line_1">If you need someone to fund your research, talk to me.</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/BackAndForthConvo_Milburn_2_Line_2">Now that you mention it, I do require a large sum of &lt;Dinks&gt;.</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/BackAndForthConvo_Milburn_2_Line_3">Large sum? Count me out.</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/BackAndForthConvo_Sheila_0_Line_0">How do you sterilise your equipment?</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/BackAndForthConvo_Sheila_0_Line_1">Sterra what?</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/BackAndForthConvo_Sheila_0_Line_2">I mean, how do you clean everything?</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/BackAndForthConvo_Sheila_0_Line_3">Just good old fashioned elbow grease, darl</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/BackAndForthConvo_Sheila_0_Line_4">…I feel ill.</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/BackAndForthConvo_Sheila_1_Line_0">They are necessary for my work.</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/BackAndForthConvo_Sheila_1_Line_1">I just never see you wear them.</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/BackAndForthConvo_Sheila_1_Line_2">You never see me at work.</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/BackAndForthConvo_Sheila_1_Line_3">You sure they’re just not for show?</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/BackAndForthConvo_Sheila_2_Line_0">Do you know why the food has these effects?</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/BackAndForthConvo_Sheila_2_Line_1">What difference does that make?</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/BackAndForthConvo_Sheila_2_Line_2">To achieve a deeper understanding!</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/BackAndForthConvo_Sheila_2_Line_3">Would that make it taste better?</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/BackAndForthConvo_nightFallbacks_0_Line_0">I reckon we should catalogue them all.</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/BackAndForthConvo_nightFallbacks_0_Line_1">Sea shells?</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/BackAndForthConvo_nightFallbacks_0_Line_2">Yes. So they’re not all over the beach willy-nilly.</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/BackAndForthConvo_nightFallbacks_1_Line_0">I miss standing at my desk.</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/BackAndForthConvo_nightFallbacks_1_Line_1">You did that all day.</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/BackAndForthConvo_nightFallbacks_1_Line_2">Not all day.</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/BackAndForthConvo_nightFallbacks_2_Line_0">I miss standing at my desk.</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/BackAndForthConvo_nightFallbacks_2_Line_1">You did that all day.</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/BackAndForthConvo_nightFallbacks_2_Line_2">Not all day.</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/BackAndForthConvo_nightFallbacks_3_Line_0">Do you think the museum is still nice and organised?</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/BackAndForthConvo_nightFallbacks_3_Line_1">I’m sure it’s fine.</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/BackAndForthConvo_nightFallbacks_3_Line_2">Maybe I should quickly go and check?</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/BackAndForthConvo_nightFallbacks_3_Line_3">NO! Stay here, it’s fine.</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/BackAndForthConvo_rainingFallbacks_0_Line_0">My fish are going crazy!</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/BackAndForthConvo_rainingFallbacks_0_Line_1">Why is that?</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/BackAndForthConvo_rainingFallbacks_0_Line_2">They know it’s raining.</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/BackAndForthConvo_rainingFallbacks_1_Line_0">But what if the museum floods?</string>
  <string name="THEODORE/BackAndForthConvo_rainingFallbacks_1_Line_1">It’s not that much rain, mate.</string>
  <string name="Npc9/Introduction_009_Intro_004"> We could fill it with all the interesting things found here on &lt;IslandName&gt;!</string>
  <string name="Npc9/Introduction_009_Intro_005">So please speak to Fletch about building the museum as soon as possible!</string>
