  <string name="JOHN/RandomConvo_006_Intro_001">Have you considered buying something?</string>
  <string name="JOHN/RandomConvo_006_Intro_002">&lt;yes&gt;That always makes me feel better.</string>
  <string name="JOHN/RandomConvo_006_Intro_003">&lt;haha&gt;You, buying something, I mean.</string>
  <string name="JOHN/RandomConvo_007_Intro_000">I wouldn’t trade trading for anything.</string>
  <string name="JOHN/RandomConvo_007_Intro_001">&lt;thinking&gt;I mean…</string>
  <string name="JOHN/RandomConvo_007_Intro_002">&lt;haha&gt;Unless it was a really good deal!</string>
  <string name="JOHN/RandomConvo_008_Intro_000">The secret to trading is to buy low, and sell high.</string>
  <string name="JOHN/RandomConvo_008_Intro_001">&lt;thinking&gt;...</string>
  <string name="JOHN/RandomConvo_008_Intro_002">&lt;sigh&gt;I probably should’ve sold you that information…</string>
  <string name="JOHN/RandomConvo_009_Intro_000">I worked hard to get the &lt;PermitPoints&gt; I needed to get my &lt;CommerceLicence&gt;.</string>
  <string name="JOHN/RandomConvo_009_Intro_001">&lt;haha&gt;My brother back in &lt;SouthCity&gt; worked really hard to get me to give him some of my &lt;PermitPoints&gt; so he could get his too!</string>
  <string name="JOHN/RandomConvo_010_Intro_000">&lt;sigh&gt;I’ve got to make enough &lt;Dinks&gt; this month or my brother will be in trouble back in &lt;SouthCity&gt;.</string>
  <string name="JOHN/RandomConvo_010_Intro_001">&lt;no&gt;I won't raise prices or anything like that...</string>
  <string name="JOHN/RandomConvo_010_Intro_002">&lt;haha&gt;Just be sure to keep selling me stuff, okay, &lt;PlayerName&gt;?</string>
  <string name="JOHN/RandomConvo_011_Intro_000">Sometimes I don’t know when to stop, you know?</string>
  <string name="JOHN/RandomConvo_011_Intro_001">&lt;haha&gt;I’ve shipped so many bugs this season I can’t even keep track of them!</string>
  <string name="JOHN/RandomConvo_012_Intro_000">&lt;PlayerName&gt;, you and I make a great team. You run around, collecting rare and valuable things, I buy them from you.</string>
  <string name="JOHN/RandomConvo_012_Intro_001">&lt;proud&gt;For a very, vary fair price I might add.</string>
  <string name="JOHN/RandomConvo_012_Intro_002">Then I sell them onto my buyer in &lt;SouthCity&gt;.</string>
  <string name="JOHN/RandomConvo_012_Intro_003">&lt;haha&gt;This way, everyone gets &lt;Dinks&gt;!</string>
  <string name="JOHN/RandomConvo_013_Intro_000">It’s become very obvious that you are my favourite customer, &lt;PlayerName&gt;.</string>
  <string name="JOHN/RandomConvo_013_Intro_001">I would offer you a discount, but my brother is actually in a bit of debt at the moment, and he really needs the &lt;Dinks&gt;!</string>
  <string name="JOHN/RandomConvo_013_Intro_002">&lt;haha&gt;But just remember that I was thinking of it, okay?</string>
  <string name="JOHN/RandomConvo_014_Intro_000">&lt;yes&gt;The people in &lt;SouthCity&gt; are happy to eat anything that isn’t &lt;BlobFish&gt;.</string>
  <string name="JOHN/RandomConvo_014_Intro_001">&lt;yes&gt;So when they get to buy the exotic fish that can be found here on &lt;IslandName&gt;, they will pay top &lt;Dink&gt; for it!</string>
  <!-- Talking about NPC: Fletch -->
  <string name="JOHN/RandomConvo_015_Intro_000">That’s a fancy &lt;Journal&gt; you’ve got there.</string>
  <!-- Talking about NPC: Fletch -->
  <string name="JOHN/RandomConvo_015_Intro_001">&lt;yes&gt;&lt;NPCName&gt; actually told me all about it.</string>
  <!-- Talking about NPC: Fletch -->
  <string name="JOHN/RandomConvo_015_Intro_002">&lt;no&gt;I can’t imagine how much it means to her.</string>
  <!-- Talking about NPC: Fletch -->
  <string name="JOHN/RandomConvo_015_Intro_003">&lt;haha&gt;She must really trust you, &lt;PlayerName&gt;!</string>
  <string name="JOHN/RandomConvo_016_Intro_000">My brother says he’s been spending a lot of time looking for new items to ship over to us here on &lt;IslandName&gt;.</string>
  <string name="JOHN/RandomConvo_016_Intro_001">&lt;thinking&gt;He assures me he’s been working a lot.</string>
  <string name="JOHN/RandomConvo_016_Intro_002">&lt;yes&gt;I hope he’s okay.</string>
  <string name="JOHN/RandomConvo_017_Intro_000">&lt;shy&gt;Thanks for doing so much business with me, &lt;PlayerName&gt;.</string>
  <string name="JOHN/RandomConvo_017_Intro_001">&lt;haha&gt;And remember, they ain’t good unless their John’s Goods!</string>
  <string name="JOHN/RandomConvo_018_Intro_000">I got a scale in my shop for weighing up any big items you can bring me.</string>
  <string name="JOHN/RandomConvo_018_Intro_001">&lt;yes&gt;Huge eggs and the like.</string>
  <string name="JOHN/RandomConvo_018_Intro_002">I’ll give you a great price for them, so it’s worth hauling them in if you can!</string>
  <string name="JOHN/RandomConvo_019_Intro_000">&lt;thinking&gt;You don’t talk too much, but your wallet does.</string>
  <string name="JOHN/RandomConvo_019_Intro_001">&lt;yes&gt;I really like that about you, &lt;PlayerName&gt;.</string>
  <string name="JOHN/RandomConvo_020_Intro_000">&lt;yes&gt;It’s nice to see you today, &lt;PlayerName&gt;.</string>
  <string name="JOHN/RandomConvo_020_Intro_001">&lt;no&gt;We don’t have to do a transaction today.</string>
  <string name="JOHN/RandomConvo_020_Intro_002">&lt;yes&gt;Having this discussion is nearly as nice as making some &lt;Dinks&gt;.</string>
  <string name="JOHN/RandomConvo_021_Intro_000">You know what &lt;PlayerName&gt;?</string>
  <string name="JOHN/RandomConvo_021_Intro_001">&lt;yes&gt;I wish my brother was more like you.</string>
  <string name="JOHN/RandomConvo_021_Intro_002">&lt;yes&gt;You work hard, you’re polite and you’re very kind.</string>
  <string name="JOHN/RandomConvo_021_Intro_003">&lt;haha&gt;He’s kind of ratbag sometimes!</string>
  <string name="JOHN/RandomConvo_022_Intro_000">&lt;no&gt;I’m sorry that the tools I sell break pretty often.</string>
  <string name="JOHN/RandomConvo_022_Intro_001">&lt;thinking&gt;I’ve asked my brother back in &lt;SouthCity&gt; to try and get higher quality products.</string>
  <string name="JOHN/RandomConvo_022_Intro_002">&lt;shy&gt;I guess he is just trying to make every &lt;Dink&gt; count...</string>
  <string name="JOHN/RandomConvo_023_Intro_000">&lt;sigh&gt;I wish I didn’t have to run my shop for so many hours a day.</string>
  <string name="JOHN/RandomConvo_023_Intro_001">&lt;haha&gt;But you know what they say, “If you aren’t open then you aren’t making &lt;Dinks&gt;”</string>
  <string name="JOHN/RandomConvo_023_Intro_002">&lt;sigh&gt;I could really use some time off though...</string>
  <string name="JOHN/RandomConvo_024_Intro_000">&lt;sigh&gt;Somebody asked me for a “Refund” the other day.</string>
  <string name="JOHN/RandomConvo_024_Intro_001">Can you believe that? They wanted ALL their dinks back!</string>
  <string name="JOHN/RandomConvo_024_Intro_002">I gave them half. Fair’s fair, I reckon.</string>
  <string name="JOHN/RandomConvo_024_Intro_003">&lt;thinking&gt; Hey, do you want half a shovel?</string>
  <string name="JOHN/RandomConvo_024_Option_000">No thanks</string>
  <string name="JOHN/RandomConvo_024_Option_001">Sure!</string>
  <string name="JOHN/RandomConvo_024_Response_000_000">Suit yourself</string>
  <string name="JOHN/RandomConvo_024_Response_001_000">&lt;thinking&gt;Hmmm… I think I’ll hold onto it for now.</string>
  <string name="JOHN/RandomConvo_024_Response_001_001">&lt;no&gt;I didn’t expect it to be in such high demand!</string>
  <string name="JOHN/RandomConvo_025_Intro_000">&lt;no&gt; Sometimes it can get quite lonely in my shop, working such long hours.</string>
  <string name="JOHN/RandomConvo_025_Intro_001">Luckily, I have hundreds and hundreds of items to keep me company.</string>
  <string name="JOHN/RandomConvo_025_Intro_002">&lt;haha&gt; Oh, and you, too!</string>
  <string name="JOHN/RandomConvo_025_Intro_003">Thanks for making time for me, &lt;PlayerName&gt;.</string>
  <string name="JOHN/RandomConvo_026_Intro_000">&lt;no&gt; Even if it’s an absolute bargain, it can be sad to part with your hard-earned &lt;Dinks&gt;.</string>
  <string name="JOHN/RandomConvo_026_Intro_001">But boy, the rush you get from a massive sale? There’s just nothing like it!</string>
  <string name="JOHN/RandomConvo_026_Intro_002">&lt;haha&gt;See, buying low and selling high isn’t just good trading advice, it’s also how I feel.</string>
  <string name="JOHN/RandomConvo_027_Intro_000">I might complain about working a fair bit, but truth is, I’m not sure what to do on my day off.</string>
  <string name="JOHN/RandomConvo_027_Intro_001">Time spent not trying to make &lt;Dinks&gt; can feel wasted, don’t you think?</string>
  <string name="JOHN/RandomConvo_027_Option_000">I get it.</string>
  <string name="JOHN/RandomConvo_027_Option_001">Not really...</string>
  <string name="JOHN/RandomConvo_027_Option_002">I don't like to work to much.</string>
  <string name="JOHN/RandomConvo_027_Response_000_000">&lt;haha&gt;You might just be a born trader after all!</string>
  <string name="JOHN/RandomConvo_027_Response_001_000">&lt;haha&gt;I might believe you if you weren't here so much!</string>
  <string name="JOHN/RandomConvo_027_Response_002_000">&lt;haha&gt;Says the person buying up all my tools!</string>
  <string name="JOHN/RandomConvo_028_Intro_000">&lt;IslandName&gt; is really starting to feel like a home.</string>
  <string name="JOHN/RandomConvo_028_Intro_001">&lt;haha&gt;I reckon it is home now!</string>
  <string name="JOHN/RandomConvo_028_Intro_002">I love waking up and having a wander around my shop every morning.</string>
  <string name="JOHN/RandomConvo_028_Intro_003">And seeing you is always a treat too, &lt;PlayerName&gt;!</string>
  <string name="JOHN/RandomConvo_029_Intro_000">Sorry I’ve been running a bit late for work lately, &lt;PlayerName&gt;.</string>
  <string name="JOHN/RandomConvo_029_Intro_001">&lt;shy&gt;I know sometimes you're in there waiting for me…</string>
  <string name="JOHN/RandomConvo_029_Intro_002">&lt;haha&gt;I guess I just want to say thanks for waiting!</string>
  <string name="JOHN/RandomConvo_030_Intro_000">&lt;glee&gt;It’s always good talking to you &lt;PlayerName&gt;.</string>
  <string name="JOHN/RandomConvo_030_Intro_001">&lt;haha&gt;It almost makes me forget that I work 12 hour days, 6 days a week.</string>
  <string name="JOHN/RandomConvo_031_Intro_000">You know, I would love to give you more great deals, &lt;PlayerName&gt;.</string>
  <string name="JOHN/RandomConvo_031_Intro_001">Mates rates, you know?</string>
  <string name="JOHN/RandomConvo_031_Intro_002">&lt;glee&gt;Because we’re good mates, right?</string>
  <string name="JOHN/RandomConvo_031_Intro_003">&lt;sigh&gt;Unfortunately, my brother says he really needs a big payment this month...</string>
  <string name="JOHN/RandomConvo_032_Intro_000">You’re a totally different person from when we met, &lt;PlayerName&gt;.</string>
  <string name="JOHN/RandomConvo_032_Intro_001">&lt;haha&gt;I mean, you’ve always been good at what you do, don’t get me wrong.</string>
  <string name="JOHN/RandomConvo_032_Intro_002">&lt;yes&gt;But I really feel like you’ve grown a lot since you helped me get set up here on &lt;IslandName&gt;.</string>
  <string name="JOHN/RandomConvo_033_Intro_000">&lt;IslandName&gt; feels like my home now.</string>
  <string name="JOHN/RandomConvo_033_Intro_001">&lt;thinking&gt;Sure, I sometimes miss &lt;SouthCity&gt;.</string>
  <string name="JOHN/RandomConvo_033_Intro_002">&lt;haha&gt;Although, if I ever went back, I would miss everyone here on &lt;IslandName&gt; a lot!</string>
  <string name="JOHN/RandomConvo_034_Intro_000">&lt;yes&gt;When my brother decided to move my business here we were taking a pretty big risk.</string>
  <string name="JOHN/RandomConvo_034_Intro_001">&lt;yes&gt;But I'm very glad he made that decision for me!</string>
  <string name="JOHN/RandomConvo_034_Intro_002">&lt;glee&gt;He doesn't know what he's missing here on &lt;IslandName&gt;!</string>
  <string name="JOHN/RandomConvo_035_Intro_000">Now that we’re friends, I feel like I can tell you a few trade secrets.</string>
  <string name="JOHN/RandomConvo_035_Intro_001">Listen, trading isn't JUST about getting a good deal you know.</string>
  <string name="JOHN/RandomConvo_035_Intro_002">&lt;thinking&gt;Oh, wait, I guess it is.</string>
  <string name="JOHN/RandomConvo_035_Intro_003">&lt;yes&gt;Yeah. Go for good deals.</string>
  <string name="JOHN/RandomConvo_035_Intro_004">&lt;haha&gt;Honestly, that's all there is to it.</string>
  <string name="JOHN/RandomConvo_036_Intro_000">&lt;yes&gt;In life, you’ve always got to decide what to hold on to and what to let go.</string>
  <string name="JOHN/RandomConvo_036_Intro_001">&lt;thinking&gt;There’s always a tradeoff…</string>
  <string name="JOHN/RandomConvo_036_Intro_002">&lt;no&gt;It wasn’t easy, moving here.</string>
  <string name="JOHN/RandomConvo_036_Intro_003">But taking a risk like this? And seeing everything work out like it has?</string>
  <string name="JOHN/RandomConvo_036_Intro_004">&lt;proud&gt;I got a feeling like it’s all gonna be worth it.</string>
  <string name="JOHN/RandomConvo_036_Intro_005">&lt;yes&gt;Just gotta keep working.
\n One day at a time.</string>
  <string name="JOHN/RandomConvo_036_Intro_006">Thanks for listening, &lt;PlayerName&gt;.</string>
  <string name="JOHN/RandomConvo_037_Intro_000">&lt;yes&gt;You know, I grew this beard when I was a bit younger.</string>
  <string name="JOHN/RandomConvo_037_Intro_001">My brother asked if he could trade me something for my moustache.</string>
  <string name="JOHN/RandomConvo_037_Intro_002">I figured it would grow back, you know?</string>
  <string name="JOHN/RandomConvo_037_Intro_003">&lt;sigh&gt;It never did…</string>
  <string name="JOHN/RandomConvo_038_Intro_000">&lt;no&gt;You know, it doesn’t bother me too much working hard to help my brother.</string>
  <string name="JOHN/RandomConvo_038_Intro_001">&lt;yes&gt;He's a good guys, he just gets himself into trouble.</string>
  <string name="JOHN/RandomConvo_038_Intro_002">&lt;no&gt;Always saying things like “Lets make some deals, let’s trade some wheels”</string>
  <string name="JOHN/RandomConvo_039_Intro_000">&lt;shy&gt;My brother says he’s too busy to come and visit me here on &lt;IslandName&gt;.</string>
  <string name="JOHN/RandomConvo_039_Intro_001">&lt;no&gt;He’s got a boat, but he says he can’t even take it out for a quick visit.</string>
  <string name="JOHN/RandomConvo_039_Intro_002">&lt;sigh&gt;It’s a real shame...</string>
  <string name="JOHN/RandomConvo_039_Intro_003">&lt;yes&gt;I think he'd like you, &lt;PlayerName&gt;.</string>
  <string name="JOHN/Storm_Greeting 0_Intro_000">&lt;yes&gt;It’s tough to do inventory with all this stormy racket…</string>
  <string name="JOHN/Storm_Greeting 0_Intro_001">What are you up to, &lt;PlayerName&gt;?</string>
  <string name="JOHN/Storm_Greeting 0_Response_003_000">Try and stay safe and dry, &lt;PlayerName&gt;!</string>
  <string name="JOHN/Storm_Greeting 1_Intro_000">&lt;no&gt;I hate all this thunder and lightning!</string>
  <string name="JOHN/Storm_Greeting 1_Intro_001">&lt;yes&gt;But it's always good to see you, &lt;PlayerName&gt;.</string>

  <string name="JOHN/TownMention_Level_001_Intro_000">It’s clear you’ve been working hard to get &lt;IslandName&gt; together, &lt;PlayerName&gt;</string>
  <string name="JOHN/TownMention_Level_001_Intro_001">It’s starting to shape up around here!</string>
  <string name="JOHN/TownMention_Level_002_Intro_000">&lt;IslandName&gt; has really changed since you help get me set up here!</string>
  <string name="JOHN/TownMention_Level_002_Intro_001">&lt;yes&gt;It’s starting to feel like home, you know what I mean?</string>
  <string name="JOHN/TownMention_Level_003_Intro_000">I can’t believe how good &lt;IslandName&gt; is looking!</string>
  <string name="JOHN/TownMention_Level_003_Intro_001">It’s amazing how much I miss while I’m at work in my shop!</string>
  <string name="JOHN/TownMention_Level_003_Intro_002">Did you do all this &lt;PlayerName&gt;?</string>
  <string name="JOHN/TownMention_Level_004_Intro_000">&lt;IslandName&gt; has never looked better!</string>
  <string name="JOHN/TownMention_Level_004_Intro_001">&lt;haha&gt;People aren’t going to want to visit my shop if you keep it looking this good, &lt;PlayerName&gt;!</string>
  <string name="JOHN/Wind_Greeting 0_Intro_000">My dad used to say “Windy weather is the best time to set sale!”</string>
  <string name="JOHN/Wind_Greeting 0_Intro_001">&lt;no&gt;No idea what he meant.</string>
  <string name="JOHN/Wind_Greeting 0_Response_003_000">&lt;sigh&gt;Oh, okay then.</string>

  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Rayne_2_Line_1">Yeah. I really like it here.</string>
  <!-- Said by John talking to Rayne -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Rayne_2_Line_2">Me too. Don't you miss being out there though?</string>
  <!-- Said by Rayne talking to John -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Rayne_2_Line_3">A little, but like, it's kinda the whole point, right?</string>
  <!-- Said by John talking to Rayne -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Rayne_2_Line_4">Missing things?</string>
  <!-- Said by Rayne talking to John -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Rayne_2_Line_5">No, like, travelling. Now it all kinda feels like... like I was just looking for somewhere the whole time. Does that make sense?</string>
  <!-- Said by John talking to Franklyn -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Franklyn_0_Line_0">Are you trying to steal my customers, mate?</string>
  <!-- Said by Franklyn talking to John -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Franklyn_0_Line_1">That is not my intention.</string>
  <!-- Said by John talking to Franklyn -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Franklyn_0_Line_2">Well, they’re all talking about your fancy gizmos and gadgets!</string>
  <!-- Said by Franklyn talking to John -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Franklyn_0_Line_3">I suppose some people just have an eye for quality.</string>
  <!-- Said by John talking to Franklyn -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Franklyn_0_Line_4">My tools are as quality as they come!</string>
  <!-- Said by Franklyn talking to John -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Franklyn_0_Line_5">Do not worry. I will not stoop to selling fruits and vegetables.</string>
  <!-- Said by John talking to Franklyn -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Franklyn_1_Line_0">You charge a heck of a lot for your contraptions.</string>
  <!-- Said by Franklyn talking to John -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Franklyn_1_Line_1">I charge precisely what they are worth.</string>
  <!-- Said by John talking to Franklyn -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Franklyn_1_Line_2">I don’t suppose you do mates rates?</string>
  <!-- Said by Franklyn talking to John -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Franklyn_1_Line_3">You can pay me more if you wish, yes.</string>
  <!-- Said by John talking to Franklyn -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Franklyn_1_Line_4">Y’know, I don’t think I’ve ever seen you actually build anything.</string>
  <!-- Said by John talking to Franklyn -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Franklyn_2_Line_0">If you like your fancy machines so much, why’d you come here? There’s heaps more of those in &lt;SouthCity&gt;!</string>
  <!-- Said by Franklyn talking to John -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Franklyn_2_Line_1">Indeed there are. Decrepit, noisy, rusty machines in need of enhancement.</string>
  <!-- Said by John talking to Franklyn -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Franklyn_2_Line_2">So why aren’t you back there fixing those up?</string>
  <!-- Said by Franklyn talking to John -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Franklyn_2_Line_3">One word. Paperwork.</string>
  <!-- Said by John talking to Franklyn -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Franklyn_2_Line_4">Hah! That’s three words, you gallah!</string>
  <!-- Said by John talking to Melvin -->

  <!-- Said by John talking to Melvin -->

  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Melvin_0_Line_3">Yup.</string>
  <!-- Said by John talking to Melvin -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Melvin_0_Line_4">…last year.</string>
  <!-- Said by John talking to Melvin -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Melvin_1_Line_0">What sort of tools do you use?</string>
  <!-- Said by Melvin talking to John -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Melvin_1_Line_1">This and that.</string>
  <!-- Said by John talking to Melvin -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Melvin_1_Line_2">I could get you a great deal on a tablesaw.</string>
  <!-- Said by Melvin talking to John -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Melvin_1_Line_3">Nah, she’ll be right mate.</string>
  <!-- Said by John talking to Melvin -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Melvin_2_Line_0">You ever planning on retiring?</string>
  <!-- Said by Melvin talking to John -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Melvin_2_Line_1">Nah, mate.</string>
  <!-- Said by John talking to Melvin -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Melvin_2_Line_2">How long you planning on making furniture for then?</string>
  <!-- Said by Melvin talking to John -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Melvin_2_Line_3">Long as I can, I reckon.</string>
  <!-- Said by John talking to Clover -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Clover_0_Line_0">Sometimes, you seem a little creepy.</string>
  <!-- Said by Clover talking to John -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Clover_0_Line_1">Kinda creepy for you to notice, y’know?</string>
  <!-- Said by John talking to Clover -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Clover_0_Line_2">What?! No it isn’t!</string>
  <!-- Said by Clover talking to John -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Clover_0_Line_3">Now you’re shouting? Such a creep.</string>
  <!-- Said by John talking to Clover -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Clover_0_Line_4">…sorry.</string>
  <!-- Said by John talking to Clover -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Clover_1_Line_0">Do you think I could sell some of your clothes in my shop?</string>
  <!-- Said by Clover talking to John -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Clover_1_Line_1">I really don’t think they’d be happy there y’know?</string>
  <!-- Said by John talking to Clover -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Clover_1_Line_2">Nah, I think they’d love it!</string>
  <!-- Said by Clover talking to John -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Clover_1_Line_3">That’s okay. You can think that.</string>
  <!-- Said by John talking to Clover -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Clover_2_Line_0">Nah mate, I haven't seen my brother in years.</string>
  <!-- Said by Clover talking to John -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Clover_2_Line_1">He's probably closer than you think, y'know?</string>
  <!-- Said by John talking to Clover -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Clover_2_Line_2">Ease up on the mumbo jumbo a little, yeah? This is family we're talking about.</string>
  <!-- Said by Clover talking to John -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Clover_2_Line_3">I'm just saying, family has a way of finding you, don't you think?</string>
  <!-- Said by John talking to Clover -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Clover_2_Line_4">For once I think you're speaking sense. He'll find me alright, when he's short on Dinks</string>
  <!-- Said by John talking to Fletch -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Fletch_0_Line_0">Hey, about that licence giving licence…</string>
  <!-- Said by Fletch talking to John -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Fletch_0_Line_1">Yeah, I’m really proud of that one.</string>
  <!-- Said by John talking to Fletch -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Fletch_0_Line_2">You got any spares?</string>
  <!-- Said by Fletch talking to John -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Fletch_0_Line_3">I really couldn’t give you one.</string>
  <!-- Said by John talking to Fletch -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Fletch_0_Line_4">I could really use it though.</string>
  <!-- Said by Fletch talking to John -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Fletch_0_Line_5">I don’t have a licence to give the licence giving licence!</string>
  <!-- Said by John talking to Fletch -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Fletch_1_Line_0">This sure is a beautiful place. Is it like you remembered?</string>
  <!-- Said by Fletch talking to John -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Fletch_1_Line_1">Mostly, yeah. I forgot how colourful everything was. &lt;SouthCity&gt; was so grey and lifeless.</string>
  <!-- Said by John talking to Fletch -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Fletch_1_Line_2">Not for much longer, with the amount of fish and bugs I’ve been selling to them!</string>
  <!-- Said by Fletch talking to John -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Fletch_1_Line_3">Maybe you’re right, but I don’t think it works like that.</string>
  <!-- Said by John talking to Fletch -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Fletch_1_Line_4">Oh?</string>
  <!-- Said by Fletch talking to John -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Fletch_1_Line_5">That place drains all the colour and life out of you.</string>
  <!-- Said by John talking to Fletch -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Fletch_2_Line_0">I’ve been thinking about branching out and selling Cactus Figs, whaddya reckon?</string>
  <!-- Said by Fletch talking to John -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Fletch_2_Line_1">I don’t like the sound of that, I’ll tell you what! Those things are terrible for my belly.</string>
  <!-- Said by John talking to Fletch -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Fletch_2_Line_2">Yeah, I don’t like them either to be honest. But what’s the harm in selling a couple?</string>
  <!-- Said by Fletch talking to John -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Fletch_2_Line_3">Prickles, that’s the harm. Those buggers are ruthless!</string>
  <!-- Said by John talking to Irwin -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Irwin_0_Line_0">How did you get into the animal business?</string>
  <!-- Said by Irwin talking to John -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Irwin_0_Line_1">It’s not really a business, mate.</string>
  <!-- Said by John talking to Irwin -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Irwin_0_Line_2">Okay, sure. How did you, though?</string>
  <!-- Said by Irwin talking to John -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Irwin_0_Line_3">I’m just love all critters, great and small.</string>
  <!-- Said by John talking to Irwin -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Irwin_1_Line_0">I sell a fair few bugs myself.</string>
  <!-- Said by Irwin talking to John -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Irwin_1_Line_1">What do people do with them?</string>
  <!-- Said by John talking to Irwin -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Irwin_1_Line_2">Y’know, I never asked.</string>
  <!-- Said by Irwin talking to John -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Irwin_1_Line_3">Are they safe, and cared for?</string>
  <!-- Said by John talking to Irwin -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Irwin_1_Line_4">Well, I put a few airholes in the boxes, yeah.</string>
  <!-- Said by John talking to Irwin -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Irwin_2_Line_0">You ever seen an alpha Pleep?</string>
  <!-- Said by Irwin talking to John -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Irwin_2_Line_1">Crikey! I wish! You’d here them cooing for miles!</string>
  <!-- Said by John talking to Irwin -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Irwin_2_Line_2">I wouldn’t go anywhere near a giant one. They’d knock you for six.</string>
  <!-- Said by Irwin talking to John -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Irwin_2_Line_3">A pleep? No way! Even massive, there’s no way they’d have it in them. Real gentle, I reckon. True softies.</string>
  <!-- Said by John talking to Irwin -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Irwin_2_Line_4">Softies… yeah… come to think of it, you’d get wool enough for the whole island.</string>
  <!-- Said by Irwin talking to John -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Irwin_2_Line_5">Trust you to be thinking about the profits.</string>
  <!-- Said by John talking to Irwin -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Irwin_2_Line_6">Nah, just the wool. You know me mate, I love a good yarn.</string>
  <!-- Said by John talking to Sally -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Sally_0_Line_0">Do you mine much?</string>
  <!-- Said by Sally talking to John -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Sally_0_Line_1">Not so much anymore.</string>
  <!-- Said by John talking to Sally -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Sally_0_Line_2">Right! Because you didn’t have the right pickaxe, yeah?</string>
  <!-- Said by Sally talking to John -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Sally_0_Line_3">I don’t have any pickaxes…</string>
  <!-- Said by John talking to Sally -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Sally_0_Line_4">Well, lucky you came to me!</string>
  <!-- Said by John talking to Sally -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Sally_1_Line_0">I think you’d have more customers if you were more confident.</string>
  <!-- Said by Sally talking to John -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Sally_1_Line_1">What do you mean?</string>
  <!-- Said by John talking to Sally -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Sally_1_Line_2">If you speak confidently more people would believe you. Talk loudly and proudly!</string>
  <!-- Said by Sally talking to John -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Sally_1_Line_3">Confident about what?</string>
  <!-- Said by John talking to Sally -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Sally_1_Line_4">Anything! Believe in yourself!</string>
  <!-- Said by Sally talking to John -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Sally_1_Line_5">Oh. Okay. Um… I’m confident that your goods are overpriced and break too easily!</string>
  <!-- Said by John talking to Sally -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Sally_1_Line_6">Sssshhh! Keep your voice down!</string>
  <!-- Said by John talking to Sally -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Sally_2_Line_0">There’s something about being in a lot of water that kind of scares me</string>
  <!-- Said by Sally talking to John -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Sally_2_Line_1">That’s pretty strange. You don’t like the ocean?</string>
  <!-- Said by John talking to Sally -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Sally_2_Line_2">Nah, not to be in, anyway. I don’t mind looking at it.</string>
  <!-- Said by Sally talking to John -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Sally_2_Line_3">Why do you think that is?</string>
  <!-- Said by John talking to Sally -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Sally_2_Line_4">I don’t know, hey. I’ve always been that way, since I was a kid.</string>
  <!-- Said by Sally talking to John -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Sally_2_Line_5">Hmm… did something happen back then?</string>
  <!-- Said by John talking to Sally -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Sally_2_Line_6">Nah. Except, if me and my brother ever got into a fight he’d swim out a little and stand on a rock taunting me.</string>
  <!-- Said by John talking to Theodore -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Theodore_0_Line_0">If you charged an admission, you’d make a killing!</string>
  <!-- Said by Theodore talking to John -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Theodore_0_Line_1">But then less people would get to see the exhibits.</string>
  <!-- Said by John talking to Theodore -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Theodore_0_Line_2">You’d make way more &lt;Dinks&gt; though!</string>
  <!-- Said by Theodore talking to John -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Theodore_0_Line_3">Maybe, but the Museum is for everybody.</string>
  <!-- Said by John talking to Theodore -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Theodore_1_Line_0">Are you sure you’re not interested?</string>
  <!-- Said by Theodore talking to John -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Theodore_1_Line_1">I’m afraid I really could’t part with any of them.</string>
  <!-- Said by John talking to Theodore -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Theodore_1_Line_2">You haven’t even heard my prices yet!</string>
  <!-- Said by Theodore talking to John -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Theodore_1_Line_3">My exhibits really aren’t for sale.</string>
  <!-- Said by John talking to Theodore -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Theodore_1_Line_4">Alright mate. Well, I’m here if you need me. Think about it.</string>
  <!-- Said by John talking to Theodore -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Theodore_2_Line_0">Hey, why don’t you get a shark for the museum?</string>
  <!-- Said by Theodore talking to John -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Theodore_2_Line_1">To be honest, I, um, don’t think I’d have any other exhibits if I did that.</string>
  <!-- Said by John talking to Theodore -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Theodore_2_Line_2">Yeah, but, you wouldn’t need them, see? You know why?</string>
  <!-- Said by Theodore talking to John -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Theodore_2_Line_3">Because I’d have a shark?</string>
  <!-- Said by John talking to Theodore -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Theodore_2_Line_4">Yeah. You’d have a shark, mate.</string>
  <!-- Said by Theodore talking to John -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Theodore_2_Line_5">Thank you. I’ll, um, definitely take that under, um, advisement.</string>
  <!-- Said by John talking to Theodore -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Theodore_2_Line_6">Mate! A shark! You’d have a bloody shark mate!</string>
  <!-- Said by Theodore talking to John -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Theodore_2_Line_7">Um…</string>
  <!-- Said by John talking to Theodore -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Theodore_2_Line_8">Shark!</string>
  <!-- Said by John talking to Milburn -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Milburn_0_Line_0">Alright, I have to ask. How do YOU make dinks?</string>
  <!-- Said by Milburn talking to John -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Milburn_0_Line_1">Wouldn’t you like to know.</string>
  <!-- Said by John talking to Milburn -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Milburn_0_Line_2">Yeah, I would, I’m in that shop six days a week!</string>
  <!-- Said by Milburn talking to John -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Milburn_0_Line_3">It’s really rather complicated, I doubt you’d understand.</string>
  <!-- Said by John talking to Milburn -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Milburn_0_Line_4">But you don’t sell anything!</string>
  <!-- Said by Milburn talking to John -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Milburn_0_Line_5">See? I told you you wouldn’t understand.</string>
  <!-- Said by John talking to Milburn -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Milburn_1_Line_0">How do you keep your suit so neat all the time?</string>
  <!-- Said by Milburn talking to John -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Milburn_1_Line_1">Hard work and determination, boy.</string>
  <!-- Said by John talking to Milburn -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Milburn_1_Line_2">See, you say that, but I don't see a single crease or stain on it. How hard can you possibly be working?</string>
  <!-- Said by Milburn talking to John -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Milburn_1_Line_3">Oh, I'm not talking about me! I order them express from &lt;SouthCity&gt;. There are extremely hard working folk there. Top of the line.</string>
  <!-- Said by John talking to Milburn -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Milburn_1_Line_4">Well, at least you're ordering something yourself then.</string>
  <!-- Said by Milburn talking to John -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Milburn_1_Line_5">Actually, I order somebody to order them. It's all very complicated. I doubt you'd understand.</string>
  <!-- Said by John talking to Milburn -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Milburn_1_Line_6">Nah mate, I understand just fine, I reckon.</string>
  <!-- Said by John talking to Milburn -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Milburn_2_Line_0">G’day mate. Did those &lt;Dinks&gt; get sent alright?</string>
  <!-- Said by Milburn talking to John -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Milburn_2_Line_1">Certainly. It was quite a large sum if I recall.</string>
  <!-- Said by John talking to Milburn -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Milburn_2_Line_2">I was just expecting to hear something back. You sure they didn’t get lost on the way?</string>
  <!-- Said by Milburn talking to John -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Milburn_2_Line_3">Do you ever hear anything back?</string>
  <!-- Said by John talking to Milburn -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Milburn_2_Line_4">…not really, now that you mention it.</string>
  <!-- Said by John talking to Sheila -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Sheila_0_Line_0">How do you sterilise your equipment?</string>
  <!-- Said by Sheila talking to John -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Sheila_0_Line_1">Sterra what?</string>
  <!-- Said by John talking to Sheila -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Sheila_0_Line_2">I mean, how do you clean everything?</string>
  <!-- Said by Sheila talking to John -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Sheila_0_Line_3">Just good old fashioned elbow grease, darl</string>
  <!-- Said by John talking to Sheila -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Sheila_0_Line_4">…I feel ill.</string>
  <!-- Said by John talking to Sheila -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Sheila_1_Line_0">They are necessary for my work.</string>
  <!-- Said by Sheila talking to John -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Sheila_1_Line_1">I just never see you wear them.</string>
  <!-- Said by John talking to Sheila -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Sheila_1_Line_2">You never see me at work.</string>
  <!-- Said by Sheila talking to John -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Sheila_1_Line_3">You sure they’re just not for show?</string>
  <!-- Said by John talking to Sheila -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Sheila_2_Line_0">Do you know why the food has these effects?</string>
  <!-- Said by Sheila talking to John -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Sheila_2_Line_1">What difference does that make?</string>
  <!-- Said by John talking to Sheila -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Sheila_2_Line_2">To achieve a deeper understanding!</string>
  <!-- Said by Sheila talking to John -->
  <string name="JOHN/BackAndForthConvo_Sheila_2_Line_3">Would that make it taste better?</string>

  <string name="JOHN/LongConvo_001_Intro_000">Hey &lt;PlayerName&gt;, do you know why I became a travelling trader?</string>
  <string name="JOHN/LongConvo_001_Intro_001">I mean, I bloody love trading, I really do, but I had always imagined trading in my own shop in &lt;SouthCity&gt;.</string>
  <string name="JOHN/LongConvo_001_Intro_002">But my brother makes ..small mistakes, sometimes.</string>
  <string name="JOHN/LongConvo_001_Intro_003">&lt;no&gt;Actually, he makes big mistakes all the time.</string>
  <string name="JOHN/LongConvo_001_Intro_004">&lt;haha&gt;But even though we’re not related by blood, I bloody love him!</string>
  <string name="JOHN/LongConvo_001_Intro_005">You see, my brother and I were both adopted.</string>
  <string name="JOHN/LongConvo_001_Intro_006">Growing up we were always trading things between each other.</string>
  <string name="JOHN/LongConvo_001_Intro_007">But when my brother got into a bit of trouble in &lt;SouthCity&gt; we needed to make &lt;Dinks&gt; and quickly!</string>
  <string name="JOHN/LongConvo_001_Intro_008">We came up with a surefire plan.</string>
  <string name="JOHN/LongConvo_001_Intro_009">One of us would become a &lt;Nomad&gt;. Travel around to the islands outside of &lt;SouthCity&gt; trading items back and forth to the other.</string>
  <string name="JOHN/LongConvo_001_Intro_010">Good plan, right?</string>
  <string name="JOHN/LongConvo_001_Intro_011">&lt;haha&gt;I thought so too!</string>
  <string name="JOHN/LongConvo_001_Intro_012">But my brother can be sneaky, &lt;PlayerName&gt;.</string>
  <string name="JOHN/LongConvo_001_Intro_013">I don’t know how it happened, but suddenly I was the one who was leaving &lt;SouthCity&gt;!</string>
  <string name="JOHN/LongConvo_001_Intro_014">Meanwhile, &lt;NPCName&gt; is the one back in &lt;SouthCity&gt; with his own store.</string>
  <string name="JOHN/LongConvo_001_Intro_015">&lt;no&gt;And he’s selling the things I send him, no less!</string>
  <string name="JOHN/LongConvo_001_Intro_016">&lt;shy&gt;I don’t know how, but he always manages to convince me his plan is the best one...</string>
  <string name="JOHN/RandomConvo_040_Intro_000">My brother still has my old steam boat back home.</string>
  <string name="JOHN/RandomConvo_040_Intro_001">&lt;thinking&gt;I hope he’s treating the old girl well.</string>
  <string name="JOHN/RandomConvo_040_Intro_002">&lt;glee&gt;She’s my pride and joy. I can’t wait to see her again some day.</string>
  <string name="Npc1/RandomConvo_003_Intro_001">&lt;haha&gt;I mean, the only thing you can catch in &lt;SouthCity&gt; are &lt;Blobfish&gt;!</string>
  <string name="Npc1/RandomConvo_024_Intro_000">&lt;sigh&gt; Somebody asked me for a “Refund” the other day. </string>
