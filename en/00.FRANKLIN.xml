  <string name="FRANKLIN/RandomConvo_000_Response_001_000">I have been conducting research.</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/RandomConvo_000_Response_001_001">Thank you for asking, &lt;PlayerName&gt;.</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/RandomConvo_001_Intro_000">&lt;thinking&gt;I am absolutely astonished with how much interesting technology can be unearthed here on &lt;IslandName&gt;.</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/RandomConvo_001_Intro_001">&lt;yes&gt;If you happen to find any, please bring it to me when I am in my lab.</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/RandomConvo_002_Intro_000">When I lived in &lt;SouthCity&gt;, I was once allowed to conduct research on the city's power source.</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/RandomConvo_002_Intro_001">&lt;shy&gt;Unfortunately, during an experiment I cut power to the whole city for 40 seconds.</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/RandomConvo_002_Intro_002">&lt;no&gt;Apparently, making discoveries is not as important as keeping people warm.</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/RandomConvo_003_Intro_000">&lt;PlayerName&gt;, I can assure you, there is a lot to be learnt from the past.</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/RandomConvo_003_Intro_001">&lt;pumped&gt;Our ancestors may have caused everything to go South, but imagine how advanced they would have had to have been to do that!</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/RandomConvo_004_Intro_000">&lt;thinking&gt;If enough information is collected, anything can be accurately predicted.</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/RandomConvo_004_Intro_001">&lt;yes&gt;Even the weather!</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/RandomConvo_005_Intro_000">&lt;yes&gt;After I start a project my brain is constantly working on it.</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/RandomConvo_005_Intro_001">&lt;thinking&gt;Right now, I am actually imagining working on something quite interesting.</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/RandomConvo_005_Intro_002">Oh, and I am having this conversation with you too, I guess.</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/RandomConvo_006_Intro_000">&lt;no&gt;I am not really in the mood for a discussion.</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/RandomConvo_006_Intro_001">&lt;thinking&gt;Let us just imagine we shared in some small talk and became closer friends because of it. Okay?</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/RandomConvo_007_Intro_000">&lt;yes&gt;I do wish there were more people here on &lt;IslandName&gt; that could have a real, intellectual discussion with.</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/RandomConvo_007_Intro_001">&lt;no&gt;But I suppose I should really be doing research anyway.</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/RandomConvo_008_Intro_000">&lt;yes&gt;Sometimes it can take me a long while to complete a project.</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/RandomConvo_008_Intro_001">&lt;haha&gt;I could probably complete a project quicker if I only focused on one thing at a time, but who has time for that?!</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/RandomConvo_009_Intro_000">&lt;thinking&gt;Do you think the whole world was like &lt;SouthCity&gt; before everything went south?</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/RandomConvo_009_Intro_001">&lt;glee&gt;Can you even imagine how magnificent a world like that would have been?</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/RandomConvo_010_Intro_000">&lt;PlayerName&gt;, the way you complete your tasks is nothing short of adequate.</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/RandomConvo_010_Intro_001">&lt;no&gt;You never fail to meet my expectations.</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/RandomConvo_011_Intro_000">&lt;thinking&gt;You know, &lt;PlayerName&gt;, you can actually be quite bright sometimes.</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/RandomConvo_011_Intro_001">I have seen some of the things you have crafted, and I must admit, I’m almost impressed.</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/RandomConvo_012_Intro_000">&lt;no&gt;There is no better feeling than finishing a long and difficult project.</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/RandomConvo_012_Intro_001">&lt;thinking&gt;Except maybe starting a brand new difficult project!</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/RandomConvo_013_Intro_000">&lt;PlayerName&gt;, I think you are actually a very interesting person to talk to.</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/RandomConvo_013_Intro_001">&lt;shy&gt;I doubt you really take in everything I tell you, but it does help to get my thoughts out verbally sometimes.</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/RandomConvo_014_Intro_000">&lt;no&gt;I just have to stay busy because there's never enough time to get everything done.</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/RandomConvo_014_Intro_001">&lt;haha&gt;I have added twice as many numbers to my clock and I am STILL running out of time!</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/RandomConvo_014_Intro_002">That was just a silly joke, &lt;PlayerName&gt;.</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/RandomConvo_014_Intro_003">&lt;no&gt;You can not actually add more time to a day by doing that.</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/RandomConvo_015_Intro_000">I used to enjoy reading.</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/RandomConvo_015_Intro_001">&lt;yes&gt;I still do from time to time.</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/RandomConvo_015_Intro_002">Of course, it is no substitute for active participation.</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/RandomConvo_016_Intro_000">&lt;yes&gt;Doing research in &lt;SouthCity&gt; was sometimes very difficult.</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/RandomConvo_016_Intro_001">&lt;thinking&gt;I feel like 75% of my time was spent filling out forms to ask for permission to do an experiment.</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/RandomConvo_016_Intro_002">&lt;glee&gt;I am very happy to be here on &lt;IslandName&gt;, where people are a lot more… oblivious to what I am actually doing.</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/RandomConvo_017_Intro_000">I have discovered that &lt;IslandName&gt; is not only a great place for research and discovery, but also a generally nice place to live.</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/RandomConvo_017_Intro_001">Who ever has allowed for a place like this to be built, is truly very clever.</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/RandomConvo_018_Intro_000">When I first met you, &lt;PlayerName&gt; I thought you were a bit of a drongo. In other words, a simpleton.</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/RandomConvo_018_Intro_001">&lt;no&gt;Although I do not think this anymore.</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/RandomConvo_018_Intro_002">&lt;worried&gt;In retrospect, perhaps I should not have shared with you that I had these thoughts at all!</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/RandomConvo_019_Intro_000">Some of the other people here on &lt;IslandName&gt; are actually quite interesting.</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/RandomConvo_019_Intro_001">&lt;thinking&gt;I have discovered that given enough study and time, other people can be nearly as interesting as the relics found around this island!</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/RandomConvo_020_Intro_000">&lt;glee&gt;Having my own lab to do research in all day has been amazing!</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/RandomConvo_020_Intro_001">I had to share a lab with 3 other people back in &lt;SouthCity&gt;.</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/RandomConvo_020_Intro_002">&lt;no&gt;There is not a lot of room to do anything even remotely interesting back there.</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/RandomConvo_021_Intro_000">&lt;yes&gt;The people that lived before the world went south were very clever.</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/RandomConvo_021_Intro_001">&lt;glee&gt;Very clever indeed!</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/RandomConvo_021_Intro_002">&lt;shy&gt;Well, besides the whole ruining the world thing they did…</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/RandomConvo_021_Intro_003">&lt;thinking&gt;That, perhaps, was not so clever...</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/RandomConvo_022_Intro_000">&lt;proud&gt;I managed to acquire all my &lt;Licences&gt; at a very young age.</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/RandomConvo_022_Intro_001">&lt;thinking&gt;You see, I was quite clever as a child.</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/RandomConvo_022_Intro_002">&lt;proud&gt;To be fair, I also had access to a lot of permit points at the time as a reward for repairing the water supply to my block.</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/RandomConvo_023_Intro_000">&lt;IslandName&gt; is a very interesting place.</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/RandomConvo_023_Intro_001">&lt;yes&gt;Yes. One might even say, it’s a great place.</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/RandomConvo_023_Intro_002">&lt;shy&gt;Oh, and the relics are also interesting too.</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/RandomConvo_024_Intro_000">&lt;thinking&gt;I am sorry, &lt;PlayerName&gt;, but I am actually thinking about something quite complex right now.</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/RandomConvo_024_Intro_001">&lt;thinking&gt;If you do not mind, perhap we could resume this conversation at a later time?</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/RandomConvo_025_Intro_000">The only thing I miss about &lt;SouthCity&gt; is the &lt;BlobFish&gt;.</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/RandomConvo_025_Intro_001">&lt;thinking&gt;While I admit they were lacking in flavour and texture, they also contained all the essential vitamins and minerals for working throughout a long night.</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/RandomConvo_025_Intro_002">You have to eat them in moderation, of course.</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/RandomConvo_026_Intro_000">There are old components hidden underground here on &lt;IslandName&gt;.</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/RandomConvo_026_Intro_001">&lt;thinking&gt;It makes me wonder how did they get there?</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/RandomConvo_027_Intro_000">&lt;yes&gt;I have been trying to get more sleep.</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/RandomConvo_027_Intro_001">&lt;sigh&gt;Unfortunately, every time I lay down I get a new idea and I have to get back up and start working on it right away!</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/RandomConvo_028_Intro_000">&lt;proud&gt;With me, you can always count on attention to detail.</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/RandomConvo_028_Intro_001">&lt;yes&gt;I am somewhat famous for it.</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/RandomConvo_028_Intro_002">What was your name again?</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/RandomConvo_029_Intro_000">We are starting to be really “bonza” now.</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/RandomConvo_029_Intro_001">Am I saying that correctly?</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/RandomConvo_030_Intro_000">Hello there, &lt;PlayerName&gt;.</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/RandomConvo_030_Intro_001">I hope you are doing well.</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/RandomConvo_030_Intro_002">...</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/RandomConvo_030_Intro_003">How was that?</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/RandomConvo_030_Intro_004">&lt;worried&gt;Did that sound genuine?</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/RandomConvo_030_Intro_005">&lt;shy&gt;I read somewhere that you should ask your friends questions like that occasionally.</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/RandomConvo_031_Intro_000">I am quite pleased that you have come to visit me today, &lt;PlayerName&gt;.</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/RandomConvo_031_Intro_001">&lt;proud&gt;You are a very satifactory friend.</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/RandomConvo_031_Intro_002">&lt;thinking&gt;In fact...</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/RandomConvo_031_Intro_003">&lt;yes&gt;I think you might even be a good friend.</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/RandomConvo_032_Intro_000">&lt;no&gt;When I first arrived on &lt;IslandName&gt; I would never have thought that you were anything more than a nuisance to my work.</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/RandomConvo_032_Intro_001">&lt;shy&gt;As it turns out, you are a good friend and a great person.</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/RandomConvo_032_Intro_002">&lt;yes&gt;As well as a nuisance to my work.</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/RandomConvo_033_Intro_000">&lt;thinking&gt; Some people say that science is a team sport.</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/RandomConvo_033_Intro_001">&lt;proud&gt;If that is the case, I would be the captain of the winning team!</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/RandomConvo_034_Intro_000">&lt;thinking&gt;Sometimes I miss the paperwork in &lt;SouthCity&gt;.</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/RandomConvo_034_Intro_001">&lt;proud&gt;Luckily I always bring my own.</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/RandomConvo_034_Intro_002">Oh, it can be incredibly tedious, but there is simply nothing like tedium to fixate the mind on greater pursuits.</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/RandomConvo_035_Intro_000">&lt;yes&gt;I’ve been thinking about the Tele-Towers recently...</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/RandomConvo_035_Intro_001">&lt;thinking&gt;Those devices probably work by destroying the user entirely, and constructing them from scratch at another location.</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/RandomConvo_035_Intro_002">&lt;no&gt;Fundamentally, it would not be the same person entering and exiting the device, although neither of them would ever notice.</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/RandomConvo_035_Intro_003">&lt;haha&gt;Probably best not to overthink it and just enjoy the marvellous convenience of it all!</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/RandomConvo_036_Intro_000">&lt;yes&gt;I would get a lot more done if I could grow an extra pair of hands.</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/RandomConvo_036_Intro_001">&lt;thinking&gt;
\nHmm… maybe…</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/RandomConvo_036_Intro_002">In the meantime, your help is almost as useful.</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/RandomConvo_036_Intro_003">&lt;proud&gt;Almost twenty-five percent as useful.</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/RandomConvo_036_Intro_004">Thank you, &lt;PlayerName&gt;.</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/RandomConvo_037_Intro_000">I suppose you are wondering why my schematics are always coloured blue?</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/RandomConvo_037_Intro_001">&lt;yes&gt;I feel we are close enough now that I can tell you.</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/RandomConvo_037_Intro_002">&lt;haha&gt;
\nThe truth is, there is an amusing anecdote about it that is frightfully interesting.</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/RandomConvo_037_Intro_003">Thank you for listening, &lt;PlayerName&gt;!</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/RandomConvo_038_Intro_000">&lt;worried&gt;My earlier work had an awful tendency to detonate when used incorrectly...</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/RandomConvo_038_Intro_001">&lt;thinking&gt;...or used correctly, or left alone.</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/RandomConvo_038_Intro_002">&lt;shy&gt;I have solved almost all of these problems now, thanks, in small part, to you.</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/RandomConvo_038_Intro_003">&lt;yes&gt;It is less exciting, but MUCH more efficient.</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/RandomConvo_039_Intro_000">&lt;yes&gt;The oppressive ceaseless clanking and whirring of loud machines was everywhere in &lt;SouthCity&gt;.</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/RandomConvo_039_Intro_001">&lt;no&gt;I miss it quite a lot.</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/RandomConvo_039_Intro_002">&lt;nop&gt;Yet I notice in you something you could not find in &lt;SouthCity&gt;, no matter where you looked.</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/RandomConvo_039_Intro_003">&lt;yes&gt;A spark I find quite admirable. You want to explore and create something new!</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/RandomConvo_039_Intro_004">&lt;yes&gt;I think this is why we get along so well.</string>

  <!-- Said by John talking to Franklyn -->
  <string name="FRANKLIN/BackAndForthConvo_John_2_Line_1">I suppose someone back in South City is doing research for you?</string>
  <!-- Said by Franklyn talking to John -->
  <string name="FRANKLIN/BackAndForthConvo_John_2_Line_2">You could say that…</string>
  <!-- Said by John talking to Franklyn -->
  <string name="FRANKLIN/BackAndForthConvo_John_2_Line_3">Then I hope you share what you have learnt soon.</string>
  <!-- Said by Franklyn talking to Clover -->

  <string name="FRANKLIN/BackAndForthConvo_Clover_0_Line_1">Sometimes.</string>
  <!-- Said by Franklyn talking to Clover -->
  <string name="FRANKLIN/BackAndForthConvo_Clover_0_Line_2">And how can I access this power?</string>
  <!-- Said by Clover talking to Franklyn -->
  <string name="FRANKLIN/BackAndForthConvo_Clover_0_Line_3">You need to feel it, y’know?</string>
  <!-- Said by Franklyn talking to Clover -->
  <string name="FRANKLIN/BackAndForthConvo_Clover_0_Line_4">Hmmm. Kinetic energy of some sort..</string>
  <!-- Said by Clover talking to Franklyn -->
  <string name="FRANKLIN/BackAndForthConvo_Clover_0_Line_5">No. Not at all!</string>
  <!-- Said by Franklyn talking to Clover -->
  <string name="FRANKLIN/BackAndForthConvo_Clover_1_Line_0">What do you mean my coat is drab?</string>
  <!-- Said by Clover talking to Franklyn -->
  <string name="FRANKLIN/BackAndForthConvo_Clover_1_Line_1">You should come and see me.</string>
  <!-- Said by Franklyn talking to Clover -->
  <string name="FRANKLIN/BackAndForthConvo_Clover_1_Line_2">I am seeing you now and my coat is just as functional as ever.</string>
  <!-- Said by Clover talking to Franklyn -->
  <string name="FRANKLIN/BackAndForthConvo_Clover_1_Line_3">I could make you a nicer coat!</string>
  <!-- Said by Franklyn talking to Clover -->
  <string name="FRANKLIN/BackAndForthConvo_Clover_1_Line_4">No thank you. This one is adequate.</string>
  <!-- Said by Franklyn talking to Clover -->
  <string name="FRANKLIN/BackAndForthConvo_Clover_2_Line_0">I have an idea for a motorised machine for sewing.</string>
  <!-- Said by Clover talking to Franklyn -->
  <string name="FRANKLIN/BackAndForthConvo_Clover_2_Line_1">Oh wow!</string>
  <!-- Said by Franklyn talking to Clover -->
  <string name="FRANKLIN/BackAndForthConvo_Clover_2_Line_2">It will pull in a lot of power though.</string>
  <!-- Said by Clover talking to Franklyn -->
  <string name="FRANKLIN/BackAndForthConvo_Clover_2_Line_3">Oh, but I don’t want it to mess with my chakras.</string>
  <!-- Said by Franklyn talking to Clover -->
  <string name="FRANKLIN/BackAndForthConvo_Clover_2_Line_4">I see.</string>
  <!-- Said by Franklyn talking to Fletch -->
  <string name="FRANKLIN/BackAndForthConvo_Fletch_0_Line_0">No such license exists.</string>
  <!-- Said by Fletch talking to Franklyn -->
  <string name="FRANKLIN/BackAndForthConvo_Fletch_0_Line_1">Well it flamin’ should!</string>
  <!-- Said by Franklyn talking to Fletch -->
  <string name="FRANKLIN/BackAndForthConvo_Fletch_0_Line_2">That is not for me to decide.</string>
  <!-- Said by Fletch talking to Franklyn -->
  <string name="FRANKLIN/BackAndForthConvo_Fletch_0_Line_3">Just… be careful, will you?</string>
  <!-- Said by Franklyn talking to Fletch -->
  <string name="FRANKLIN/BackAndForthConvo_Fletch_0_Line_4">Fine. I will sell only four at a time.</string>
  <!-- Said by Franklyn talking to Fletch -->
  <string name="FRANKLIN/BackAndForthConvo_Fletch_1_Line_0">Do you remember much about the Shiny Discs?</string>
  <!-- Said by Fletch talking to Franklyn -->
  <string name="FRANKLIN/BackAndForthConvo_Fletch_1_Line_1">How old do you think I am?!</string>
  <!-- Said by Franklyn talking to Fletch -->
  <string name="FRANKLIN/BackAndForthConvo_Fletch_1_Line_2">Honestly, I could not begin to estimate.</string>
  <!-- Said by Fletch talking to Franklyn -->
  <string name="FRANKLIN/BackAndForthConvo_Fletch_1_Line_3">Well it was before my time, I’ll tell you what!</string>
  <!-- Said by Franklyn talking to Fletch -->
  <string name="FRANKLIN/BackAndForthConvo_Fletch_2_Line_0">Did your father ever venture into the deep mines?</string>
  <!-- Said by Fletch talking to Franklyn -->
  <string name="FRANKLIN/BackAndForthConvo_Fletch_2_Line_1">Oh, my father went everywhere, I’ll tell you what!</string>
  <!-- Said by Franklyn talking to Fletch -->
  <string name="FRANKLIN/BackAndForthConvo_Fletch_2_Line_2">Then perhaps you would answer a few questions?</string>
  <!-- Said by Fletch talking to Franklyn -->
  <string name="FRANKLIN/BackAndForthConvo_Fletch_2_Line_3">Sure, how long you got?</string>
  <!-- Said by Franklyn talking to Fletch -->
  <string name="FRANKLIN/BackAndForthConvo_Fletch_3_Line_0">This island must have been remarkable in its heyday.</string>
  <!-- Said by Fletch talking to Franklyn -->

  <!-- Said by Fletch talking to Franklyn -->
  <string name="FRANKLIN/BackAndForthConvo_Fletch_3_Line_3">That would’ve been long before my father’s time, I’ll tell you what!</string>
  <!-- Said by Franklyn talking to Fletch -->
  <string name="FRANKLIN/BackAndForthConvo_Fletch_3_Line_4">Oh...</string>

  <!-- Said by Franklyn talking to Irwin -->
  <string name="FRANKLIN/BackAndForthConvo_Irwin_0_Line_2">You could make them stronger, faster, better!</string>
  <!-- Said by Irwin talking to Franklyn -->
  <string name="FRANKLIN/BackAndForthConvo_Irwin_0_Line_3">I think they’re fine just the way they are, thanks.</string>
  <!-- Said by Franklyn talking to Irwin -->
  <string name="FRANKLIN/BackAndForthConvo_Irwin_1_Line_0">But with the right upgrades...</string>
  <!-- Said by Irwin talking to Franklyn -->
  <string name="FRANKLIN/BackAndForthConvo_Irwin_1_Line_1">I heard you, I’m just not interested, mate.</string>
  <!-- Said by Franklyn talking to Irwin -->
  <string name="FRANKLIN/BackAndForthConvo_Irwin_1_Line_2">Think of the possibilities!</string>
  <!-- Said by Irwin talking to Franklyn -->
  <string name="FRANKLIN/BackAndForthConvo_Irwin_1_Line_3">Just leave nature alone, yeah?</string>
  <!-- Said by Franklyn talking to Irwin -->
  <string name="FRANKLIN/BackAndForthConvo_Irwin_2_Line_0">Does the smell not bother you?</string>
  <!-- Said by Irwin talking to Franklyn -->
  <string name="FRANKLIN/BackAndForthConvo_Irwin_2_Line_1">A little, but you’re not that bad, mate!</string>
  <!-- Said by Franklyn talking to Irwin -->
  <string name="FRANKLIN/BackAndForthConvo_Irwin_2_Line_2">I am speaking of your creatures.</string>

  <!-- Said by Franklyn talking to Sally -->
  <string name="FRANKLIN/BackAndForthConvo_Sally_1_Line_0">I spent yesterday arranging my instruments.</string>
  <!-- Said by Sally talking to Franklyn -->
  <string name="FRANKLIN/BackAndForthConvo_Sally_1_Line_1">Is that why you cancelled your appointment?</string>
  <!-- Said by Franklyn talking to Sally -->
  <string name="FRANKLIN/BackAndForthConvo_Sally_1_Line_2">I did not make an appointment.</string>
  <!-- Said by Sally talking to Franklyn -->
  <string name="FRANKLIN/BackAndForthConvo_Sally_1_Line_3">I’m free tomorrow, my client list is pretty short.</string>
  <!-- Said by Franklyn talking to Sally -->
  <string name="FRANKLIN/BackAndForthConvo_Sally_1_Line_4">Of that, I am certain.</string>
  <!-- Said by Franklyn talking to Sally -->
  <string name="FRANKLIN/BackAndForthConvo_Sally_2_Line_0">Have you considered adding restraints to your chair?</string>
  <!-- Said by Sally talking to Franklyn -->
  <string name="FRANKLIN/BackAndForthConvo_Sally_2_Line_1">I don’t think it’s going to go anywhere.</string>
  <!-- Said by Franklyn talking to Sally -->

  <!-- Said by Theodore talking to Franklyn -->
  <string name="FRANKLIN/BackAndForthConvo_Theodore_0_Line_1">Categorization and filing!</string>
  <!-- Said by Franklyn talking to Theodore -->
  <string name="FRANKLIN/BackAndForthConvo_Theodore_0_Line_2">Of course, but what then?</string>
  <!-- Said by Theodore talking to Franklyn -->
  <string name="FRANKLIN/BackAndForthConvo_Theodore_0_Line_3">Re-categorization and re-filing!</string>
  <!-- Said by Franklyn talking to Theodore -->
  <string name="FRANKLIN/BackAndForthConvo_Theodore_1_Line_0">Do you dissect your specimens?</string>
  <!-- Said by Theodore talking to Franklyn -->
  <string name="FRANKLIN/BackAndForthConvo_Theodore_1_Line_1">Oh, no! I could never do that!</string>
  <!-- Said by Franklyn talking to Theodore -->
  <string name="FRANKLIN/BackAndForthConvo_Theodore_1_Line_2">Then you are missing out on so much knowledge!</string>
  <!-- Said by Theodore talking to Franklyn -->
  <string name="FRANKLIN/BackAndForthConvo_Theodore_1_Line_3">I think um, maybe that’s okay?</string>
  <!-- Said by Franklyn talking to Theodore -->
  <string name="FRANKLIN/BackAndForthConvo_Theodore_2_Line_0">How did you collect all of your specimens?</string>
  <!-- Said by Theodore talking to Franklyn -->
  <string name="FRANKLIN/BackAndForthConvo_Theodore_2_Line_1">Oh! &lt;PlayerName&gt; has been helping.</string>

  <!-- Said by Milburn talking to Franklyn -->
  <string name="FRANKLIN/BackAndForthConvo_Milburn_0_Line_3">If I need something done, I would simply pay someone.</string>
  <!-- Said by Franklyn talking to Milburn -->

  <!-- Said by Milburn talking to Franklyn -->

  <!-- Said by Franklyn talking to Milburn -->
  <string name="FRANKLIN/BackAndForthConvo_Milburn_1_Line_2">But you can play with the very laws of nature here!</string>
  <!-- Said by Milburn talking to Franklyn -->
  <string name="FRANKLIN/BackAndForthConvo_Milburn_1_Line_3">If there were any laws I would have started suing long ago.</string>

  <!-- Said by Franklyn talking to Sheila -->
  <string name="FRANKLIN/BackAndForthConvo_Sheila_0_Line_2">I mean, how do you clean everything?</string>
  <!-- Said by Sheila talking to Franklyn -->
  <string name="FRANKLIN/BackAndForthConvo_Sheila_0_Line_3">Just good old fashioned elbow grease, darl</string>
  <!-- Said by Franklyn talking to Sheila -->

  <!-- Said by Franklyn talking to Sheila -->

  <!-- Said by Franklyn talking to Sheila -->
  <string name="FRANKLIN/BackAndForthConvo_Sheila_2_Line_2">To achieve a deeper understanding!</string>
  <!-- Said by Sheila talking to Franklyn -->

  <string name="FRANKLIN/LongConvo_001_Intro_000">Hey, &lt;PlayerName&gt;. I was wondering if you knew much about the &lt;Shifts&gt;?</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/LongConvo_001_Intro_001">I actually have a theory about why &lt;IslandName&gt; seems to be unaffected by them.</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/LongConvo_001_Option_000">What are shifts?</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/LongConvo_001_Response_000_000">Oh, a &lt;Shift&gt; is when the earth's tectonic plates quickly shift slightly.</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/LongConvo_001_Response_000_001">&lt;yes&gt;This can cause absolutely catastrophic damage to settlements built too close to a plate's edge.</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/LongConvo_001_Response_000_002">These &lt;Shifts&gt; are slowly moving all the earth’s landmass south.</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/LongConvo_001_Response_000_003">As you probably know, that’s where the phrase “going south” comes from.</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/LongConvo_001_Response_000_004">&lt;haha&gt;&lt;SouthCity&gt; has been largely unaffected by these &lt;Shifts&gt;, mostly likely because it’s tectonic plate is as south as it can get already!</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/LongConvo_001_Response_000_005">But &lt;IslandName&gt; and some of the other smaller islands seem to be unaffected by the &lt;Shifts&gt;.</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/LongConvo_001_Response_000_006">&lt;thinking&gt;They stay where they are and only the earth below is caught in the &lt;Shift&gt; and moves south.</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/LongConvo_001_Response_000_007">Now, this is my theory - &lt;IslandName&gt; is not actually connected to its tectonic plate.</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/LongConvo_001_Response_000_008">&lt;haha&gt;&lt;IslandName&gt; is actually floating!</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/LongConvo_001_Response_000_009">I need to do more research to confirm this, but I feel like I am onto something.</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/LongConvo_001_Response_000_010">&lt;yes&gt;I doubt you understood most of what I was saying, but I do appreciate you listening to me, &lt;PlayerName&gt;.</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/LongConvo_002_Intro_000">&lt;yes&gt;Oh, &lt;PlayerName&gt;. It is actually a pleasure to see you today. I was kind of hoping we would interact with each other.</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/LongConvo_002_Intro_001">You see, some people can find me a little… condescending at times.</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/LongConvo_002_Option_000">Only sometimes...</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/LongConvo_002_Response_000_000">Hmmm, maybe you misunderstood the previous statement?</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/LongConvo_002_Response_000_001">Regardless of what they say, I have always found it difficult to interact with other people for long periods of time.</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/LongConvo_002_Response_000_002">&lt;yes&gt;I prefer for people to skip pleasantries and just get to the point.</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/LongConvo_002_Response_000_003">&lt;thinking&gt;But, as we have interacted more and more, I have come to realise that I am occasionally quite fond of our interactions.</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/LongConvo_002_Response_000_004">&lt;shy&gt;So I just wanted to say, thank you, &lt;PlayerName&gt;.</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/LongConvo_002_Response_000_005">&lt;yes&gt;May we occasionally have interactions in the future.</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/LongConvo_003_Intro_000">&lt;PlayerName&gt;.</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/LongConvo_003_Intro_001">You see, the people before the world went south knew a lot about storing and creating information.</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/LongConvo_003_Intro_002">I have been trying to decipher this information into a readable format.</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/LongConvo_003_Intro_003">Now if I am correct, and I usually am, this format could actually be used to describe how nature works. How the world works!</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/LongConvo_003_Intro_004">How everything works!</string>
  <string name="FRANKLIN/LongConvo_003_Intro_005">&lt;yes&gt;I just need more time. I need more &lt;itemName&gt;. If you find any, please bring them to me!</string>
