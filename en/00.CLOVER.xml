  <string name="CLOVER/RandomConvo_035_Intro_000">Sometimes it feels like we’re being watched, y’know?</string>
  <string name="CLOVER/RandomConvo_035_Intro_001">&lt;thinking&gt;Like there is someone listening to our conversation right now.</string>
  <string name="CLOVER/RandomConvo_035_Intro_002">Do you ever get that feeling?</string>
  <string name="CLOVER/RandomConvo_036_Intro_000">&lt;pumped&gt;When you feel that creative spark, you have to grab onto it tightly.</string>

  <string name="CLOVER/RandomConvo_036_Intro_002">&lt;pumped&gt;Hold onto that energy as long as you can and use it for something really special.</string>

  <string name="CLOVER/RandomConvo_037_Response_001_000">I feel that too!</string>
  <string name="CLOVER/RandomConvo_037_Response_001_001">It’s like I have to follow a script sometimes?</string>
  <string name="CLOVER/RandomConvo_037_Response_001_002">&lt;yes&gt;At least I got the part though, y’know?</string>
  <string name="CLOVER/RandomConvo_037_Response_002_000">That’s not a confident answer at all!</string>
  <string name="CLOVER/RandomConvo_037_Response_002_001">What a weird answer to choose, y’know?</string>

  <!-- Said by Sally talking to Clover -->
  <string name="CLOVER/BackAndForthConvo_Sally_1_Line_1">When was that?</string>
  <!-- Said by Clover talking to Sally -->
  <string name="CLOVER/BackAndForthConvo_Sally_1_Line_2">Maybe it hasn’t happened yet?</string>
  <!-- Said by Sally talking to Clover -->
  <string name="CLOVER/BackAndForthConvo_Sally_1_Line_3">No, it definitely has.</string>
  <!-- Said by Clover talking to Sally -->
  <string name="CLOVER/BackAndForthConvo_Sally_1_Line_4">How can you be sure though?</string>

  <!-- Said by Sally talking to Clover -->
  <string name="CLOVER/BackAndForthConvo_Sally_1_Line_7">Ummm… I guess… I’m not anymore?</string>
  <!-- Said by Clover talking to Sally -->
  <string name="CLOVER/BackAndForthConvo_Sally_1_Line_8">It’ll be nice to meet you!</string>
  <!-- Said by Sally talking to Clover -->

  <string name="CLOVER/BackAndForthConvo_Sally_2_Line_1">What’s that?</string>
  <!-- Said by Clover talking to Sally -->
  <string name="CLOVER/BackAndForthConvo_Sally_2_Line_2">I know who you remind me of now</string>
  <!-- Said by Sally talking to Clover -->
  <string name="CLOVER/BackAndForthConvo_Sally_2_Line_3">Oh, who?</string>
  <!-- Said by Clover talking to Sally -->
  <string name="CLOVER/BackAndForthConvo_Sally_2_Line_4">A big spiky Kidna.</string>
  <!-- Said by Sally talking to Clover -->
  <string name="CLOVER/BackAndForthConvo_Sally_2_Line_5">I’m not spiky at all! Wait, why did you say big?!</string>
  <!-- Said by Clover talking to Sally -->
  <string name="CLOVER/BackAndForthConvo_Sally_2_Line_6">No, you’re focusing on the wrong part. Kidnas seem kinda shy, y’know?</string>
  <!-- Said by Sally talking to Clover -->
  <string name="CLOVER/BackAndForthConvo_Sally_2_Line_7">Yeah, um, I guess</string>
  <!-- Said by Clover talking to Sally -->
  <string name="CLOVER/BackAndForthConvo_Sally_2_Line_8">But then when things really get tough, y’know what they do?</string>
  <!-- Said by Sally talking to Clover -->
  <string name="CLOVER/BackAndForthConvo_Sally_2_Line_9">Um. Spike things?</string>
  <!-- Said by Clover talking to Sally -->
  <string name="CLOVER/BackAndForthConvo_Sally_2_Line_10">No! Well, yeah! But, they also just roll right on by. They just keep right on rolling.</string>
  <!-- Said by Sally talking to Clover -->
  <string name="CLOVER/BackAndForthConvo_Sally_2_Line_11">I keep on rolling?</string>
  <!-- Said by Clover talking to Theodore -->
  <string name="CLOVER/BackAndForthConvo_Theodore_0_Line_0">You ever want to just scrunch all your papers up?</string>
  <!-- Said by Theodore talking to Clover -->
  <string name="CLOVER/BackAndForthConvo_Theodore_0_Line_1">What? No!</string>
  <!-- Said by Clover talking to Theodore -->
  <string name="CLOVER/BackAndForthConvo_Theodore_0_Line_2">Just tear them to shreds and wing it?</string>
  <!-- Said by Theodore talking to Clover -->
  <string name="CLOVER/BackAndForthConvo_Theodore_0_Line_3">That sounds like madness! You’ve gone mad!</string>
  <!-- Said by Clover talking to Theodore -->
  <string name="CLOVER/BackAndForthConvo_Theodore_0_Line_4">C’mon Teddy! Live a little!</string>
  <!-- Said by Theodore talking to Clover -->
  <string name="CLOVER/BackAndForthConvo_Theodore_0_Line_5">I’m quite alright, thank you.</string>
  <!-- Said by Clover talking to Theodore -->
  <string name="CLOVER/BackAndForthConvo_Theodore_1_Line_0">You ever wonder if we’re in a museum, too?</string>
  <!-- Said by Theodore talking to Clover -->
  <string name="CLOVER/BackAndForthConvo_Theodore_1_Line_1">There’s no way! For one thing, where’s the glass?</string>
  <!-- Said by Clover talking to Theodore -->
  <string name="CLOVER/BackAndForthConvo_Theodore_1_Line_2">You’re behind glass already! You’re a spectacle!</string>
  <!-- Said by Theodore talking to Clover -->
  <string name="CLOVER/BackAndForthConvo_Theodore_1_Line_3">I’m bespectacled.</string>
  <!-- Said by Clover talking to Theodore -->
  <string name="CLOVER/BackAndForthConvo_Theodore_1_Line_4">Yeah, that’s what I’m saying. There’s probably another Teddy out there right now, collecting all of us!</string>
  <!-- Said by Theodore talking to Clover -->
  <string name="CLOVER/BackAndForthConvo_Theodore_1_Line_5">Oh! I hope so! I’d love to be a collectable. Mint condition, of course.</string>
  <!-- Said by Clover talking to Theodore -->
  <string name="CLOVER/BackAndForthConvo_Theodore_2_Line_0">What do you think you’ll do when you finish your research paper?</string>
  <!-- Said by Theodore talking to Clover -->
  <string name="CLOVER/BackAndForthConvo_Theodore_2_Line_1">Probably I’ll write another one.</string>
  <!-- Said by Clover talking to Theodore -->
  <string name="CLOVER/BackAndForthConvo_Theodore_3_Line_0">Hey, I’m sorry, but I lost that camera I borrowed from you.</string>
  <!-- Said by Theodore talking to Clover -->
  <string name="CLOVER/BackAndForthConvo_Theodore_3_Line_1">I don’t um, think I loaned you a camera.</string>
  <!-- Said by Clover talking to Theodore -->
  <string name="CLOVER/BackAndForthConvo_Theodore_3_Line_2">No, I borrowed one though. I lost it.</string>

  <!-- Said by Milburn talking to Clover -->
  <string name="CLOVER/BackAndForthConvo_Milburn_0_Line_1">It was so long ago, I really can’t recall.</string>
  <!-- Said by Clover talking to Milburn -->
  <string name="CLOVER/BackAndForthConvo_Milburn_0_Line_2">It has such a loud voice, y’know?</string>
  <!-- Said by Milburn talking to Clover -->
  <string name="CLOVER/BackAndForthConvo_Milburn_0_Line_3">It should too, the &lt;Dinks&gt; I spent on it!</string>
  <!-- Said by Clover talking to Milburn -->
  <string name="CLOVER/BackAndForthConvo_Milburn_0_Line_4">You remember the price but not where you got it?</string>
  <!-- Said by Milburn talking to Clover -->
  <string name="CLOVER/BackAndForthConvo_Milburn_0_Line_5">I never forget a bill, my dear.</string>
  <!-- Said by Clover talking to Milburn -->
  <string name="CLOVER/BackAndForthConvo_Milburn_1_Line_0">You have a very powerful aura.</string>
  <!-- Said by Milburn talking to Clover -->
  <string name="CLOVER/BackAndForthConvo_Milburn_1_Line_1">What is that supposed to mean?</string>
  <!-- Said by Clover talking to Milburn -->
  <string name="CLOVER/BackAndForthConvo_Milburn_1_Line_2">It’s all… thunderbolts… and solitude.</string>
  <!-- Said by Milburn talking to Clover -->
  <string name="CLOVER/BackAndForthConvo_Milburn_1_Line_3">How’s that work?</string>
  <!-- Said by Clover talking to Milburn -->
  <string name="CLOVER/BackAndForthConvo_Milburn_1_Line_4">I’m not sure. It’s like… the loneliest storm on the darkest night.</string>
  <!-- Said by Milburn talking to Clover -->
  <string name="CLOVER/BackAndForthConvo_Milburn_1_Line_5">Hmph.</string>
  <!-- Said by Clover talking to Milburn -->
  <string name="CLOVER/BackAndForthConvo_Milburn_1_Line_6">Yeah, that’s what I’m talking about! I dig it, y’know?</string>
  <!-- Said by Clover talking to Milburn -->
  <string name="CLOVER/BackAndForthConvo_Milburn_2_Line_0">You really suit a moustache.</string>
  <!-- Said by Milburn talking to Clover -->
  <string name="CLOVER/BackAndForthConvo_Milburn_2_Line_1">Thanking you. Dignified, yes?</string>
  <!-- Said by Clover talking to Milburn -->
  <string name="CLOVER/BackAndForthConvo_Milburn_2_Line_2">Does that mean “Rah rah rah! Grrrrrr!”? Because, yes. All the way yes.</string>
  <!-- Said by Milburn talking to Clover -->
  <string name="CLOVER/BackAndForthConvo_Milburn_2_Line_3">No!</string>
  <!-- Said by Clover talking to Milburn -->
  <string name="CLOVER/BackAndForthConvo_Milburn_2_Line_4">Awwww. That’s a shame, y’know?</string>
  <!-- Said by Clover talking to Sheila -->
  <string name="CLOVER/BackAndForthConvo_Sheila_0_Line_0">You should stay open later,y’know?</string>
  <!-- Said by Sheila talking to Clover -->

  <!-- Said by Clover talking to any NPC -->
  <string name="CLOVER/BackAndForthConvo_morningFallbacks_1_Line_2">I feel like I’ve done this already?</string>
  <!-- Said by Clover talking to any NPC -->

  <!-- Said by Clover talking to any NPC -->
  <string name="CLOVER/BackAndForthConvo_dayFallbacks_1_Line_0">Stay away from the water this afternoon.</string>
  <!-- Said by any NPC talking to Clover -->

  <!-- Said by Clover talking to any NPC -->
  <string name="CLOVER/BackAndForthConvo_dayFallbacks_1_Line_2">Just a feeling.</string>

  <!-- Said by Clover talking to any NPC -->
  <string name="CLOVER/BackAndForthConvo_rainingFallbacks_2_Line_2">Yeah, it’s my fault. Sorry.</string>
  <string name="CLOVER/LongConvo_001_Intro_000">Hey, &lt;PlayerName&gt;.</string>
  <string name="CLOVER/LongConvo_001_Intro_001">Y'know, I’ve been wondering, why did you decide to leave &lt;SouthCity&gt;?</string>
  <string name="CLOVER/LongConvo_001_Option_000">It was terrible there!</string>
  <string name="CLOVER/LongConvo_001_Option_001">I needed a change</string>
  <string name="CLOVER/LongConvo_001_Option_002">There was nothing there for me.</string>
  <string name="CLOVER/LongConvo_001_Response_000_000">Crikey, I’m glad someone said it!</string>
  <string name="CLOVER/LongConvo_001_Response_000_001">Although, it’s a bit more common to hear that around here on &lt;IslandName&gt;.</string>
  <string name="CLOVER/LongConvo_001_Response_000_002">&lt;no&gt;There’s nothing there for people like us.</string>
  <string name="CLOVER/LongConvo_001_Response_001_000">I understand. I really do.</string>
  <string name="CLOVER/LongConvo_001_Response_001_001">&lt;shy&gt;Sometimes you need a big shift in life like that to rearrange your life.</string>
  <string name="CLOVER/LongConvo_001_Response_001_002">&lt;yes&gt;Get things rolling in a different direction, y’know?</string>
  <string name="CLOVER/LongConvo_001_Response_002_000">&lt;yes&gt;I know exactly what you mean.</string>
  <string name="CLOVER/LongConvo_001_Response_002_001">People like that have a powerful aura about us, y’know?</string>
  <string name="CLOVER/LongConvo_002_Intro_000">&lt;proud&gt;I left &lt;SouthCity&gt; because no one could handle my fashion.</string>
  <string name="CLOVER/LongConvo_002_Intro_001">&lt;no&gt;Feels like everyone there is happy wearing grey all day long.</string>
  <string name="CLOVER/LongConvo_002_Intro_002">I want my clothes to carry a bit of my energy, y’know?</string>
  <string name="CLOVER/LongConvo_002_Intro_003">I guess I like to think that everything I make contains a part of me, and I’m passing that energy onto whoever wears it.</string>
  <string name="CLOVER/LongConvo_002_Intro_004">&lt;no&gt;My family was mortified when I told them I wanted to be a &lt;Nomad&gt;.</string>
  <string name="CLOVER/LongConvo_002_Intro_005">They’re just locked into their grey ways, y’know?</string>
  <string name="CLOVER/LongConvo_002_Intro_006">&lt;SouthCity&gt; does that to people..</string>
  <string name="CLOVER/LongConvo_002_Intro_007">It’s like the city puts people under a spell that makes them lame for life.</string>
  <string name="CLOVER/LongConvo_002_Intro_008">&lt;glee&gt;I’m just glad we got away from that place, right, &lt;PlayerName&gt;?</string>
  <string name="CLOVER/LongConvo_003_Intro_000">Hey &lt;PlayerName&gt;. Do you believe in magic?</string>
  <string name="CLOVER/LongConvo_003_Intro_001">&lt;yes&gt;You see, I didn’t believe myself until I came across an old book in the &lt;SouthCity&gt; library...</string>
  <string name="CLOVER/LongConvo_003_Intro_002">&lt;thinking&gt;This book describes an energy that runs through us all, y’know?</string>
  <string name="CLOVER/LongConvo_003_Intro_003">&lt;pumped&gt;An energy that makes up everything in our world.</string>
  <string name="CLOVER/LongConvo_003_Intro_004">You can kind of feel it, a kind of rhythm playing in everything.</string>
  <string name="CLOVER/LongConvo_003_Intro_005">I feel like it's close to a C-Sharp.</string>
  <string name="CLOVER/LongConvo_003_Intro_006">Anyway, I’ve been trying to harness that energy ever since I left &lt;SouthCity&gt;.</string>
  <string name="CLOVER/LongConvo_003_Intro_007">&lt;thinking&gt;It’s definitely easier to feel here on &lt;IslandName&gt;...</string>
  <string name="CLOVER/LongConvo_003_Intro_008">&lt;shy&gt;I’m starting to sound crazy, aren’t I?</string>
